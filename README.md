Hello world! 

I'm Taha, a statistics student who will probably encounter some obstacles while trying to get a hang on 
some stuff. Which may happen to anyone else! So this is my way to communicate my solutions to other 
people with the same problems. In doing so, I will remember how I did it, and maybe find a better way of 
doing it by counteracting with you!

Stats on and enjoy!
