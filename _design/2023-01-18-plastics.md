    excerpt: 'A significant amount of plastic is missing from the surface of the oceans and has accumulated on shorelines. From the 1950s to 2015, a total of 82 million tonnes of macroplastics (larger than 0.5 cm in diameter) and 40 million tonnes of microplastics (smaller than 0.5 cm in diameter) have been found. Macroplastics can break down into microplastics, which can persist even longer and be harmful for a longer period of time. <br>Here're the amount of plastics produced in different decades that can still be found on shorelines today. In the comparison below, we can see a steady rise in the presence of plastics over time and the long-term persistence of plastics on shorelines.<br>However, it is not too late to make a difference by properly disposing of plastics. We can all play a role in this by picking up and properly disposing of our own plastic waste.'
