# Position Description

This is a unique position providing training in applied machine learning and scientific leadership in high performance computing.  The successful candidate will develop and co-lead several two-day ARS-wide training workshops on scientific computing, and will help organize communities of scientific practice in machine learning for metagenomics across the ARS. The topics will vary, but past examples have included machine learning, microbiome science, and working with Data Carpentry on their curriculum (https://datacarpentry.org/). The successful candidate will have the opportunity to develop skills in python package development, software development practices, and machine learning applications.


This position has wide latitude to develop an independent research program in areas like the prediction of pathogen phenotypes from metagenomics data, developing new methods for polygenic scoring, linking host genotypes to microbiomes, and modeling microbial communities with probabilistic graphical models. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on additional data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with metagenomics.  

# Preferred skills:

* Experience with high performance computing
* Experience in microbiology, computational biology, statistics, or computer science
* Strong communication and organizational skills
* Experience or interest in teaching

I recognize that each person
has a unique mix of experience and individual strengths and I encourage any
applicant with a strong record of research productivity and relevant experience
to apply, even if your mix of skills is different than what is listed above. Compensation includes competitive postdoctoral pay and benefits.
