# Description

 SCINet Fellow: Applying locality-sensitive hash methods to rapidly search petabytes of unassembled metagenomics data


ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit in Gainesville, Florida. Other work locations are also possible.

Research Project: The U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety; and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. Nearly 2000 scientists and support staff conduct research within the ARS research enterprise.

The SCINet/Big Data Fellows Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in working on agricultural-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computing clusters (HPC). The objective of this fellowship program is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for a fellow to use the HPC to search abd analyze large metagenomics datasets.

Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will have the opportunity to gain experience developing a large-scale cloud compute and high performance computing system for indexing and searching petabyte-scale genomics and metagenomics datasets using locality sensitive hashing. There is also the opportunity to learn to develop statistical models for normalizing the sensitivity and recall of search by locality-sensitive hashing.


Learning Objectives: The participant will learn HPC computing technologies and will help develop and co-lead ARS-wide workshops, resulting in a community of scientific practice in computational metagenomics.The participant will have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on metagenomics, microbiomes, real-time pathogen monitoring, and machine learning applications in agriculture.
