# The Research

Our lab has a postdoc opening to develop predictive models of soil microbe interactions from metagenomic and exo-metabolomic time-series data.  We have time-series data on the rhizospheres of resistant and susceptible tomato plants infected by the model soil pathogen *Ralstonia solanacearum*. We are applying [neural relational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04687) and Bayesian networks to identify microbial and metabolite interactions and gain a more mechanistic understanding of the ecosystem.

There are also opportunities to lead projects on the Bayesian optimization of microbial consortia, protein expression optimization with tunable promoters, and work in structural metagenomics using Alphafold and Rosetta.
