When you're learning some new techniques I find it's easy to get confused. Having a good tutorial that has the right amount of detail
helps me get my bearings. It's not just about the content, the presentation matters too.
Here's some of the best Unity tutorials out there. All have content based on Unity 5+ but the majority have material covering earlier 
verions too.

### Cooking With Unity
>Hellooo and welcome to another exciting episode of Cooking with Unity! I'm your host Max Maroe ...
Max's intro still brings a smile to my face. He covers a wide range of game mechanics from [Space Invaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNEIpNjrcUg) to [Beat 'em ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bhfsAoPmD4).
His most recent series was a Diablo style game called [Scape](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlHjNcdoyw6XdeywdBBMemGS14BUv4RTI) in Unity 5 spanning about 15 hours. Max has also done a parallel series called
[Breakfast with Unity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlHjNcdoyw6WVpwY7_InRc6vYFS3bEPar) which covers [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF8CNgHZ-bA&list=PLlHjNcdoyw6WVpwY7_InRc6vYFS3bEPar&index=67), [HDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onE_Zt0FjH0&list=PLlHjNcdoyw6WVpwY7_InRc6vYFS3bEPar&index=88), [Vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wno6t6iZmqM&list=PLlHjNcdoyw6WVpwY7_InRc6vYFS3bEPar&index=78) and tons more. 
If you want to make a game in Unity, check if he's got a video to help you. Prolific, entertaining, and a real lover of games.

### Sebastian Lague
I saw my first Seb Lague vid when it was featured on the Unity3d tutorial section. Clicking 
through to his youtube channel I found more videos on [procedural generation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eZgMK_DT5_biRkWXftAOf9) and more recently a [series for complete beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0fnA91TcmkRyhhixX9CO3Lw).
If you want a taster of his style and abilities, check out the [Field of View](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dohbtVgHDNmgZV_UY7xZv7) 3 parter. Doing a light-cone field of view with a 
generated mesh and then using a shader to highlight only the right parts. Some nifty programming and 
he really goes the extra mile with his presentation and explanations.
