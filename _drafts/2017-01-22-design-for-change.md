One of the only constants in software development is change.

We should design for change.

Don't fix things too early..
  * sub-optimisation.
  * OOP tends to concrete ideas early.
  * trad. data modelling
    * static view
    * fixed

model messages instead
  * data fixed only at edges of system
  * expressive way of sharing data vocabulary across components -Spec
    / Schema

[//] # investigate graphQL as well
