## 1. Setting the Stage

TODO

## 2. The Problem

In software development, especially in systems dealing with data transactions like user portfolios, data validation is crucial. Ensuring that data conforms to expected formats and rules is vital for maintaining the integrity of the system. However, traditional object-oriented approaches sometimes fall short in providing flexible and reusable validation mechanisms. This brings us to the exploration of an alternative approach using Type Classes in Kotlin.

## 3. How Object-Oriented Languages Solve the Problem

Object-oriented languages typically handle validation through inheritance and polymorphism. This approach, while powerful, can sometimes lead to rigid class hierarchies and can lack the expressiveness needed for more complex validation scenarios. For instance, extending classes or implementing interfaces for each validation rule can quickly become unwieldy.

## 4. Type Classes: A Solution for Functional Languages

Type classes offer a solution by allowing us to define a set of behaviors (like validation rules) that can be applied to various types without altering the types themselves. This is particularly useful in a language like Kotlin, which supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

### Example: Validating a DTO

Consider the `CreatePortfolioDTO` class in Kotlin:

```kotlin
data class CreatePortfolioDTO(val userId: String, val amount: Double)
```

This DTO needs validation for `userId` and `amount`. Using type classes, we can define generic validation rules that are decoupled from the data type.

### Implementing Type Classes in Kotlin with Context Receivers

Kotlin's Context Receivers feature provides a way to implement type classes elegantly. Here's an example implementation using your provided code:

```kotlin
// [Your provided code snippet here]
```

This implementation defines a series of validation rules (`Required`, `Positive`, `NonZero`) and applies them to the `CreatePortfolioDTO` fields. The beauty of this approach lies in its reusability and the ability to compose validations.

## 5. Conclusion

Type classes in Kotlin offer a powerful tool for solving common problems in a more flexible and composable manner than traditional object-oriented approaches. By leveraging Kotlin's functional programming features, we can write cleaner, more maintainable code that scales well with complexity.
