I wanted to get a nice free website, hosted on GitHub's speedy servers, that I can update without any special tools.

First step is to visit some examples of jekyll sites already hosted on Github.
* [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
* [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
* [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)

I choose [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) because I liked the look and it came with some great documentation. With [this guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) ( with screenshots! ) I got it installed and configured.

Although Github is made for hosting git repositories it's possible to use and edit Jekyll without even installing it.
You can edit posts and pages through the web interface as well as upload and move / rename files.
