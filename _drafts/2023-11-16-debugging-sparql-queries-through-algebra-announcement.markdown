The Open mic session starts on Friday 24th November 2023 at 10:30 at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). The speaker is [Miroslav Blaško](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#miroslav-blaško) who opens the topic of Debugging SPARQL Queries using algebra.


##### The abstract

Semantics of SPARQL queries can be expressed by SPARQL Algebra. Tools like [SPARQL Validator](http://sparql.org/query-validator.html) provides [translation of SPARQL queries into its algebraic representation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#sparqlQuery). 
The talk will explore a few perplexing examples of SPARQL queries, illustrating how the translation can be used to understand/debug such queries.
