## Bilingual Experience

Children will have the opportunities to learn Mandarin Chinese and English through stimulating, age-appropriate, hands-on daily activities. Using Reggio Emilia Inspired approach to learning, children enhance their skills in a second language in the same natural way they learned their first language. Through active involvement and playful activities, children hear and speak the Mandarin Chinese language and learn about important elements of Chinese culture and heritage.

## Mission Statement

Rising Star Chinese School serves young children by providing a developmentally appropriate and play-based curriculum which promotes each child's social/emotional, physical and cognitive development.

## Our Philosophy

We offer an experiential learning environment, encouraging individual self-esteem, independence, and positive peer relationship and interactions.  We believe that helping children learn to accept what is special about themselves and others is very important.  Our program offers a safe, developmentally appropriate environment for toddlers to school age children.  It is offering many explorations in art, music, dramatic play, large motor activities, blocks, games, science, math, reading, and writing skills, social studies, and language arts.
