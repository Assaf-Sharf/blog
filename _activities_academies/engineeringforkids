## Serving Portland Metro Area

We, at the Portland Metro Engineering For Kids, are passionate about our programs because we believe that early exposure to STEM education has a lasting impact on a child's future.

At Engineering For Kids, we put the excitement in STEM education by offering fun, hands-on learning for children ages 4 to 14. Our offering includes activities that range from building rockets and roller coasters to making foam and flub to programming video games and robots. The variety of programming is extraordinary!
