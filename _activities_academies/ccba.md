### School History

With long-standing history, the Portland Chinese Language School was established in 1901 by Oregon Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association CCBA. Since then, numerous students and people from all walks of life have studied and learned Chinese from the Chinese school. Over the years, generations after generations, many respectable teachers, who made great devotion and contribution, dedicated their time to promote Chinese culture and teach the Chinese language. The school has always been in Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association building in Portland China Town, in order to provide better traffic access and attract more students who are eager to learn and study Chinese culture and languages, the school was relocated to the second floor of Mt Scott Hall within the campus of PCC (Portland Community College) (Address: 2305 SE 82nd and Division, Portland, OR 97216), the roomy classrooms are equipped with advanced educational facilities for both the students and the teachers.

### Purpose

Teach and promote Chinese language and culture. Help the students and the Portlanders who love Chinese culture to learn Chinese and understand China’s 5000 years history and traditional culture.
