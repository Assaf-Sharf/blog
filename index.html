<p>These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I’ve been fasting for Ramadan, reading, and taking on exciting projects at work.</p>

<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/career/mentorship_program" title="/categories/career/mentorship_program"><strong>Mentorship Program</strong></a> - I’ve started a <strong>free</strong> mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.</p>
<ul>
<li>This last week I had a seminar with the engineering team at Asaadhub. I had a great time talking with the team and sharing my ideas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Cerc -</strong> I started working at Cerc, where I am developing their core technology written in Golang. I am gaining a lot of knowledge into <code>geth</code> (<code>go-ethereum</code>) and other nifty projects in the crypto space.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am currently working on a new application that keeps track of the Beacon Chain.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Health and wellness -</strong> I am done reading the Omnivores Dilemma, and it has been incredibly eye-opening. The book highlights our relationship with food and how our food is grown. Over the last few weeks, I have made a more significant effort to be more mindful of the things I put into my body. I have primarily been eating vegetables (that I put in my ninja air fryer) and grass feed meats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography by Theodore Roosevelt -</strong> I am reading President Roosevelt’s autobiography, and I must say, it is genuinely marvelous. President Roosevelt was a true gentleman with a kind heart and a strong moral compass. He has also lived a full life, which is what I am currently reading.</p></li>
</ul>
