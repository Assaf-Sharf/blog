<p>I am currently learning <a href="/categories/math/linear_algebra">linear algebra</a>. Here, I go over important concepts within the topic. I focus more on fundamental ideas over computation, because these ideas are applicable to other fields and subjects.</p>

<p>I have also taken an interest in <a href="/categories/art/drawing/">drawing</a> and <a href="/categories/english/poetry/">poetry</a>. These fields are not my strong suit, but I am doing my best to expand my knowledge.</p>
