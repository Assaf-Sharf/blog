Hello!

I am a Software - Machine Learning Engineer currently hunting for my next gig! 
I was working as a Field Engineer at Domino Data Lab. Prior to this I got my Masters 
degree from the Department of Computer Science, Stevens Institute of Technology. I finished my 
thesis - Robust Learning of Halfspace in the presence of Agnostic Noise - advised by Prof. Jie Shen and Prof. Eduardo Benelli.

My interests lie in building applications, preferably in the Machine Learning space.
I have worked on various projects leveraging mathematical techniques to develop optimized algorithms.
