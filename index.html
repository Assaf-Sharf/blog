<p>These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I’ve been interviewing at a few places, learning new things, reading, and focusing on my health.</p>
<h2 id="professional">Professional</h2>
<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/categories/mastery"><strong>Mastery</strong></a> <strong>-</strong> I have finished re-reading one of my favorite books, <em>Mastery</em> by Robert Greene. The last chapter has strung a chord with me. I am creating various posts on <a href="/categories/mastery"><em>Mastery</em></a> to further explore its meaning and implications on my own life.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/categories/career/mentorship_program"><strong>Mentorship Program</strong></a> - I’ve started a <strong>free</strong> mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Role -</strong> I have taken up a new role in the blockchain space. I will be working on a new layer two blockchain. I am incredibly excited about this opportunity.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Health and wellness -</strong> I have immersed myself in the “human” sciences over the last few weeks. Two podcasts that have been particularly interesting to me have been the <a href="https://www.abdulrabbani.com/categories/learning/podcast/lifespan">“Lifespan” podcast by Dr. Sinclair</a> and the <a href="https://www.abdulrabbani.com/categories/learning/podcast/huberman_lab">“Huberman Lab” podcast by Dr. Huberman</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ve enjoyed learning more about health and wellness. It’s an incredibly fascinating topic. I’ve also been implementing new protocols in my day-to-day life.</p></li>
<li><p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve been doing a 22 hour fast, and I love it. I get a bit hungry 2 hours before it’s time to eat, but it’s taking time for my body to adjust its new Ghrelin secretion cycles.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve also started to read more scientific journals. I’ve subscribed to “Nature,” one of the leading scientific journals. This has led me to check things that I hear and believe by seeking out the scientific literature.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning Albanian</strong> - I am still <a href="/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian">learning Albanian</a>, it’s not easy, but it’s been gratifying. I love speaking to my partner in her native tongue and trying to string together sentences.</p></li>
</ul>
