<p>I moved into my new apartment this month. It has been a great, if not tiring experience. I am enjoying my new neighborhood very much.</p>

<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/categories/career/mentorship_program"><strong>Mentorship Program</strong></a> - I’ve started a <strong>free</strong> mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Beacon Chain -</strong> I have finally wrapped up a major application I have been building to keep track of the Ethereum Beacon Chain. It will run in production for the new few weeks and I will study it.</p></li>

<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Biking -</strong> I just got a bike and I’ve been riding around NYC. If anyone wants to go on a nice long bike ride, I would love to do it!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Four Agreements -</strong> I have just finished “The Four Agreements” by Don Miguel Ruiz, a terrific author. His book “The Mastery of Love” is one of my favorites, and Ruiz never fails to deliver. Every line in this book packs a punch and carries great meaning. I highly recommend this book to everyone, and I hold every agreement in high regard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography by Theodore Roosevelt -</strong> I am reading President Roosevelt’s autobiography, which is genuinely marvelous. President Roosevelt was a true gentleman with a kind heart and a strong moral compass. He has also lived a full life, which is what I am currently reading.</p></li>
