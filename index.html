  Bi-Weekly Updates: 02/15/22 - 03/01/22

<p>
  These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I’ve been
  interviewing at a few places, learning new things, reading, and focusing on my
  health.

<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Mastery -</strong> I have finished re-reading one of my favorite
      books, <em>Mastery</em> by Robert Greene. The last chapter has strung a
      chord with me. I am creating various posts on
      <a href="/categories/mastery"><em>Mastery</em></a> to further explore its
      meaning and implications on my own life.

        “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful
        servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has
        forgotten the gift.” - Albert Einstein.

      <a href="/categories/career/mentorship_program"
        ><strong>Mentorship Program</strong></a
      >
      - I’ve started a <strong>free</strong> mentorship program to help people
      start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone
      interested, please give them my contact information.

    <p>
      <strong>Learning React</strong> - I am learning how to create front-end
      websites using React. I am happy to get exposure to front-end development.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Interviews</strong> - I have been interviewing with some
      outstanding organizations over the last few weeks. I am doing my best to
      be incredibly mindful during this process. I want to build a home for
      myself in my next role.
    </p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>My Parents Became U.S Citizens</strong> - After 15 long years, my
      parents are finally U.S citizens. They left their life in Saudi Arabia on
      September 9th, 2001, and came to the West. After being pushed around from
      the U.S → Canada → U.S, they have finally gained their citizenship. They
      studied day and night for the civics, reading, and writing tests. I am so
      grateful for their sacrifices for my siblings and me. I love my parents
      very much, and I am forever in their debt.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      <strong>Health and wellness -</strong> I have immersed myself in the
      “human” sciences over the last few weeks. Two podcasts that have been
      particularly interesting to me have been the
      <a

        >“Lifespan” podcast by Dr. Sinclair</a

      and the

      >.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          I’ve enjoyed learning more about health and wellness. It’s an
          incredibly fascinating topic. I’ve also been implementing new
          protocols in my day-to-day life.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Over the last few weeks, I’ve been doing a 22 hour fast, and I love
          it. I get a bit hungry 2 hours before it’s time to eat, but it’s
          taking time for my body to adjust its new Ghrelin secretion cycles.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I’ve also started to read more scientific journals. I’ve subscribed to
          “Nature,” one of the leading scientific journals. This has led me to
          check things that I hear and believe by seeking out the scientific
          literature.

      <strong>Learning Albanian</strong> - I am still
      <a href="/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian"

      in her native tongue and trying to string together sentences.
