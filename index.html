<p>These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I’ve been interviewing at a few places, learning new things, reading, and focusing on my health.</p>
<h2 id="professional">Professional</h2>
<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/mastery" title="/categories/mastery"><strong>Mastery</strong></a> <strong>-</strong> I have finished re-reading one of my favorite books, <em>Mastery</em> by Robert Greene. The last chapter has strung a chord with me. I am creating various posts on <a href="https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/mastery" title="/categories/mastery"><em>Mastery</em></a> to further explore its meaning and implications on my own life.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/career/mentorship_program" title="/categories/career/mentorship_program"><strong>Mentorship Program</strong></a> - I’ve started a <strong>free</strong> mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.</p>
<ul>
<li>This last week I had a seminar with the engineering team at Asaadhub. I had a great time talking with the team and sharing my ideas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Cerc -</strong> I started working at Cerc, where I am developing their core technology written in Golang. I am gaining a lot of knowledge into <code>geth</code> (go-ethereum) and other nifty projects in the crypto space.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Health and wellness -</strong> I am almost done reading the Omnivores Dilemma, and it has been incredibly eye-opening. The book highlights our relationship with food and how it has been grown. Over the last few weeks, I have made a more significant effort to be more mindful of the things I put into my body. I have primarily been eating vegetables (that I put in my ninja air fryer) and grass feed meats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning Albanian</strong> - I am still <a href="https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian" title="/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian">learning Albanian</a>, it’s not easy, but it’s been gratifying. I love speaking to my partner in her native tongue and trying to string together sentences.</p></li>
</ul>
