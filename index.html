<p>I’ve been working on a few exciting things in the last few months. But most recently, I am trying to enjoy this warm summer weather.</p>

<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>My team and I have rebuilt our entire market data pipeline in Rust. Rust is the best programming language known to man.</li>
<li>I’ve built out my own product, <a href="https://neuralcanopy.com/">Neural Canopy</a>, an AI prompt template. I am still working on it and appreciate any feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve started training Muay Thai and a bit of BJJ. I miss combat sports and I thought I would enjoy BJJ more than striking, but there’s something about throwing a combination and having it land that feels just right.</li>
<li>I’ve also started coaching high school wrestling on Sundays. This has been something I’ve wanted to do for years. I am very happy to have taken the leap.</li>
</ul>
