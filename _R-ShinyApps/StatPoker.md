[StatPoker: an educational app](https://hamagust.shinyapps.io/StatPoker2/)

Following the logic of gamification of teaching, I have implemented and promoted changes in the game originally described by Leech (2008) in classroom statistics courses since 2009. This webapp comprises the first implementation version for an e-learning context.

**Didactic objectives:**

Fix the definitions of central tendency and variability: mean, standard, variance, calculation of measures, quartiles, interquartile range, median deviation.
Develop analytical analysis for central location and dispersion of data.

Originaly inspired on: LEECH, Nancy L. Statistics Poker: Reinforcing Basic Statistical Concepts. Teaching Statistics. Volume 30, Number 1, Spring 2008, p. 26- 28. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9639.2007.00309.x

R Packages: shiny, flexdashboard, and dplyr.
