[PatAnalytics](https://hamagust.shinyapps.io/patAnalyticsM5_V/)

**PROPOSAL:** Analysis of technological panorama based on analysis of patent related data.

The shiny app comprises the visualization module and shows the results for the technological subjects already analyzed contained in the database.

Patents comprise a relevant open data source for strategic decision making and competitiveness for companies. The patent analysis enable to anticipate information regarding commercial product launch, technological trends and also forecast technologies life cycle in specific1,2,3.But the amount of registered patents are massive, and the analysis of all data is humanly impossible without establishing knowledge discovery mechanisms to aid decision making.

There are at least two kind of users of patent related data. Patent identifiers use content of one patent, verifying opportunity in each patent, for a business of to assess technology patentability. Patent analysts use information from massive conjoint of patent data to generate useful knowledge for business related decision making4. This kind of knowledge discovery is needed in open innovation, and market for ideas and technologies context, core of knowledge based economy.
