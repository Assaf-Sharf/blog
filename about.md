<div class="about">

Hi,

My name is Kristof and i've been a sysadmin since 2011.<br>
Along with one more sysadmin i'm responsible for about 360 employees and 450 client devices,<br> spread out over different locations.
<br>
Over the years i developed an interest in many aspects.<br>
Windb and WPA (Windows performance Analyzer), SCCM, Powershell are the ones i find the most interesting.<br>
Since the end of 2015 i've picked up on Powershell. Eversince i've been created tools and little scripts <br> to ease the workload. I try to automate as much as i can.
<br><br>
The idea is to use this blog to write about the more fun or challenging problems i come across.<br> I'll mainly be blogging for my own reference but maybe my work can be of use to someone else aswell.<br> This can be a PowerShell script, but it can also be a WPA analysis, a GPO solution , ... .<br> The repositories will be documented with a README and some basic info.<br> 
<br><br>
You can contact me via Twitter or you can find me on LinkedIn.
