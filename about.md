## About Myself
My name is Abdul Rabbani, I am a self-educated computer scientist.
I have been working in the Technical field for several years, and have a wide variety of skill sets.
From low-level knowledge on Operating Systems to high-level application design.
I have learned about and worked with a broad range of technologies and tools.

In my professional career, I primarily focus on infrastructure and scalability.
In the future, I can see myself working more deeply with OS and low-level hardware development.

# Purpose of This Site
The main purpose of this website is for me to have a collection of my work.
As I previously stated, I am self-educated, and I love to learn.
I wanted to have a place where I could openly write about topics that are of interest to me.
I will be having various types of articles. Some will be more refined, others will be loosely structured.

I also want people to easily be able to collaborate with people who might be interested in the things I am writing about.
Feel free to comment about things you like, dislike, agree with, disagree with, or want further explanation on.

## Types of Posts
Let me give you an example:
My favorite branch of Mathematics is Calculus.
- I could write an article on the importance of Calculus to me and the influence it has had in my life.
This type of post would be a  __Personal__ post, where I am writing about an aspect of my life.
- I could also write a post on how I believe all High Schools should offer Calculus classes.
This type of post would be an __Opinionated__ post, where I am sharing an idea, or something that I believe.
- I could also write a post explaining the *Fundamental Theorem Of Calculus*.
 This type of post would be a __Factual__ post, where I am explaining something (correctly I hope).
 - I may also write about a brand new finding I might have in Calculus.
 This type of post would be a __Discovery__ post, where I am explaining in thorough detail, my scientific discovery.
- I may be learning about a new topic within Calculus, and I might create a post with explanations, questions, and other notes I have about the topic.
This type of post would be a __Notes__ post (I know, very creative).
This will more than likely be the most common type of post on this site.


# Professional Work Experience
## Currently
I am currently a DevOps Engineer at a start-up called PromoteIQ, which is owned by Microsoft.
PromoteIQ is an advertising firm that works in the private market place.
My job here is to maintain all the servers, networks, applications, and infrastructure to be able to serve ads for our clients.

Part of being a good DevOps Engineer is making sure you are not doing the same work twice. Infrastructure, applications, networks, servers, and other pieces of technology constantly need to be replicated.
Technology is great because if you're lazy (like me), you can program it to do a lot for you.
Some of the tools that I leverage to make my life easier are *Ansible, Python, Terraform, Jenkins*.

Like many companies, we live on the cloud, and not just one. To meet client needs we have applications on *AWS, GCP, Rackspace and Digital Ocean*.
Due to strong leadership, and smart engineers, we can serve clients out of various clouds with ease. PromoteIQ is a smart, sleek, and truly advanced shop in today's day in age.

## Past Experience
Before working for PromoteIQ, I was an SRE at Societe Generale, primarily focusing on the technology of the high-frequency trading desk.
My main focus was maintaining trading applications, with latency and performance in mind.
Some of my topics of interest were *Microwaves, Market Data and Smart Order Routing (SOR)*.

At SocGen, I learned to work very closely with physical hardware.
Although I touched not a single server in my time there, I was quickly able to decipher the right tool for the right job.
I also learned to become a proficient programmer at SocGen with the help of some very talents individuals.

I started by learning *Python* and quickly began working on the ILP (Internal Market Provider) project.
The purpose of the project was to produce market data for our clients,
and have them route orders to us the way they would to a protected market.
I used Python to improve a program that insured that we were executing our clients at the best price on the market (Easier said than done).
Working on the ILP project gave me a deeper and richer insight into the complexity of market data.

I eventually moved onto *C/C++*.
Although I left before I could show my skills in *C/C++*, I would like to believe that my former colleagues would be happy with my growth.
