During my PhD studies, I worked as a teaching assistant and delivered tutorials for the following courses on research methods and introduction to political science.

## Undergraduate level

- **L2305: Research Methods for Political Scientists**, fall 2016 (focus on quantitative methods) and fall 2017 (focus on research design, ethics and qualitative methods), Government & Public Policy, University of Strathclyde, course leaders: Dr Brandenburg and Dr Shephard 

- **L2103: Politics 1b**, spring 2016, Government & Public Policy, University of Strathclyde, course leader: Dr Gabriela Borz 

- **L2102: Politics 1a**, fall 2015, Government & Public Policy, University of Strathclyde, course leader: Dr Gabriela Borz

In future, I look forward to teaching substantive courses on media and democracy, digital technologies and politics, and government transparency. As a student, I learnt most effectively when I could actively participate and have firsthand concrete experience with the discussed subject. Therefore, where possible, I aim to design substantive courses to encourage discussions and include hands-on experience with software or programming language in methods classes. I value diversity and strive for creating an inclusive environment where students feel free to engage and express their views.
