## ID-1 - Probability and Statistics : From Classical to Bayesian
* **Mentors:** Aniket Kumar, Pranay Agarwal, Munish Gupta  
* **Description :** This Project will guide you through the basics of Probability Theory, data generation , decision theory , Bayesian Analysis and then application of Bayesian to real world problems.
The project would be of immense help to many as probability theory has wide applications ranging from its use in the corporate world to the realm of research in almost any field. Familiarity with probability theory helps theoreticians and experimentalists alike.  
* **Expected Duration :** 2 months  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment:** 4-5 hours  

## ID-2 - Communicating Mathematics
**Mentors:** Harshit Bisht  
**Description :** Disclaimer: This project will very likely be useless for both jobs and MS/PhD admissions. You have been warned.

Mathematical concepts are often disconnected from people's reality, people don't relate to statistics shared by politicians, economists, public organizations, and other domains that are relevant to everyday life. The project would aim to create examples, counterexamples, simulations, and games to connect math concepts to their relevance to the world at large.
Some arbitrary examples:

- Law of large numbers and population statistics : A biased coin that lands H 99% of the time feels like it would never land tails, but if you flip it enough the sample distribution would converge to the true distribution. This is similar to if a country/society takes a 1% individual risk together, in a country of 1B more than 10M are affected.
- Basic reproduction number (R0) and how to understand contagiousness of a disease.
- Why do people talk about dummy candidates in elections? Are there election systems where no one has incentive to start dummy candidates (and what are the flaws of such systems?)

Since this will a project of interest/love more than technical depth, the participating group can be decided based on how many people want to do this. Please note that unfortunately, this will be a project where your communication skills might be barrier, but please don't shy away from applying if you feel interested.  
**Expected Duration :** 2-3 months  
**Expected Weekly Commitment:** 5 hours  

## ID-3 - The Dynamics of Life
**Mentors:** Mohit Kulkarni
**Description :** In this course we wish to discover aspects of mathematics widely used in dynamical systems with application to biology. Nature has beautiful patterns as well as chaos, we wish to understand how dynamical systems work particularly in the brain. Initial weeks would cover basic biology and basic mathematics required thereafter. Here we will try to get an intuituon on why mathematics and biology aren't completely different areas. Later, we will understand what a network, what chaos is and why dynamics is important. We will look into one/two dimensional dynamical systems(would also include the dynamics of a neuron). Later topics will depend on you and may include RNN's, large-scale neural models, attractor dynamics etc. 

Maths may be difficult to understand, so we will take the help of cool visualisations. Programming knowledge(any language) is a plus but not required.

Some books we may refer to(Tentative)
1. Mathematics of Life, Ian Stewart,
2. Nonlinear dynamics and chaos, Steven Strogatz
3. Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience, Eugene Izhikevich  
**Expected Duration :** 8 weeks  
**Expected Weekly Commitment:** 4  

## ID-4 - Number Theory and Algebra  
**Mentors:** Ajay Prajapati, Hargun Preet Singh Bhatia, 
**Description :** The goal of this project is to give a gentle introduction to Modern Number theory. We will cover basic topics like Divisibility, modular arithmetic, Euler's theorem, fundamental theorem of arithmetic, quadratic residues and Gauss's famous Quadratic reciprocity law. Along the way, we will introduce several key algebraic objects like groups, rings and fields. If time permits, we will talk about some well known problems in the field like Dirichlet's theorem for primes in Arithmetic progressions and the Riemann hypothesis.  
**Expected Duration :** 2-3 months  
**Expected Weekly Commitment:** 3-4 hours  

## ID-5 - Application of Maths in Algorithms
**Mentors:** Utkarsh Gupta  
**Description :** The project will cover diophantine equations, Gauss elimination, Hashing, mobius inversion, etc.  
**Expected Duration :** 4 weeks  
**Expected Weekly Commitment:** 25 hrs  

## ID-6 - Mathematical Finance & Stochastic Processes
**Mentors:** Aditya Prakash Singh
**Description :** We will first study some basic financial concepts such as time value of money, arbitrage and risk & return. Further, we will study the most basic derivatives prevalent in the market and finally we will learn how these derivates are priced and hopefully derive the celebrated Black-Scholes equation.

Disclaimer - This project will NOT teach you how to trade in the market. It will definitely help you to understand the market and its instruments better.

Pre-reqs: None.  
**Expected Duration :** 3 months  
**Expected Weekly Commitment:** 4-5 hours  

## ID-7 - Computer Vision: A Classic and Modern approach
**Mentors:** Shivanshu Tyagi, Akshay Gupta
**Description :** This project will cover the basics of computer Vision, then dive into some classic computer vision algorithms and then finally will cover the modern Deep Learning approaches in CV. 

The proposed project would roughly have the following structure:
1. Introduction: an introduction of Computer Vision and some basic Linear Algebra and numpy required for the later parts of the project.
2. Image processing: This portion will start with color spaces and conversions,Image Transformations(rotation, scaling, translation, etc.), then cover filters and kernels (noise removal, blurring, image thresholding) and finally conclude with hough transform, Edge detection(Canny Edge Detection) and contour detection algorithms(Watershed). Can also cover feature detection, depending upon the response.
3. ML for Vision: Here, we'll deal with some basics of Deep Neural Networks and talk about convolutions(also covered in image processing part), various optimizers, backpropagation algorithm, Gradient Descent, SGD various Loss functions and their usages in CV context, Regularizations and Bias-Variance trade off.
4. Applications: In this part we'll talk about some famous algorithms for some basic computer vision tasks.
        - Image Classification: Inception, VGG and Resnet.
        - Object detection: SSD, YOLO
        - Face Detection: HAAR cascades

We'll accompany each lecture with a fun CTF type assignment along with some further readings.

For implementation, we'll use opencv, numpy in the starting. At later stages we'll include pytorch.  
**Expected Duration :** 3 Months
**Expected Weekly Commitment:** 4-5 hrs
