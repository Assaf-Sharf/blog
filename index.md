# Technical Writer by day, learning developer by night.

I graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in [Informatics](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/). Ever since then, I've been continuing to learn more about programming by enrolling in classes at the [City College of San Francisco](https://www.ccsf.edu/). Thus far, I've taken classes in data structures and algorithms in Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript frameworks, and SQL.

I'm also a [Salesforce Pathfinder](https://pathfinder.salesforce.com/s/) alumnus, earning my Salesforce Platform Developer 1 cert at the end of the program. I try to work towards my Administrator cert if I have any spare time.

Currently, I am fortunate enough to write documentation at [Amazon](https://www.aws.amazon.com).

When I'm not writing documentation or code, I like to watch re-runs of Seinfeld and read mystery and legal thriller novels (which I'm told is what _old_ people like to do, so I don't like admitting it).
