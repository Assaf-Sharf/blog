## About

Welcome to the Third DialDoc Workshop co-located with [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org).

DialDoc workshop focuses on Document-Grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering. 
Given the vast amount of content created every day in various mediums, it is a meaningful yet challenging task not only to make such content _accessible_ to end users via various conversational interfaces but also to make sure the responses provided by the models are _grounded_ and _faithful_ with respect to the knowledge sources. The purpose of this workshop is to invite researchers and practitioners to bring their individual perspectives on the subject of grounded dialogue and conversational question answering to advance the field in a joint effort. We also host a shared task on grounded dialogue based on multilingual documents, which aims to extend the current advances to languages other than English.

Topics of interests include but not limited to
- Document-grounded dialogue and conversational machine reading;
- Knowledge-grounded dialogue generation with pre-trained language models;
- Open domain dialogue and conversational QA;
- Topical open-domain conversational chat;
- Parsing semi-structured document content for dialogue and conversational QA, table reading;
- Evaluation for document-grounded dialogue;
- Interpretability and faithfulness in dialogue modeling;
- Dialogue summarization and query-based summarization.
