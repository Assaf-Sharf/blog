I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland's Atmospheric and
Oceanic Science department in [Dr. Jacob Wenegrat](https://wenegrat.github.io/)'s group.
My research interests have been focused on numerical simulations of turbulent environments
in geophysical boundary layers in general (both oceanic and atmospheric). More recently I
began investigating submesoscale phenomena in the oceanic bottom boundary layer.
