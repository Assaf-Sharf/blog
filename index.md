# Hello Everyone
This website is a collection of my various interests, projects, reports,
learning experiences, and much more.

Please check out the [categories](/categories) section to
see topics I have written about.

You can also find more information [about](/about) the purpose of my website.

# Currently in Progress

## Math
I am currently learning [linear algebra](/categories/math/linear_algebra),
here I am going over important concepts within the topic.
I am focusing more in fundemental ideas over computation, as the ideas are
what are carried over to other fields and subjects.

## Art and Literature
I have also taken an interest to [drawing](/categories/art/drawing/)
and [poetry](/categories/english/poetry/).
These fields are certainly not my strong suit, but I am doing my best
to expand my knowledge and reach.
