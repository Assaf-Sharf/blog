# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Politics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland (expected to graduate in June 2020). I am interested in the area of comparative politics and political economy, substantively in the digital technologies and politics, the effects of information, public demand for government information, and how the government responds to this demand.

I enjoy analysing data as much as I like talking to people, so when possible, I try to combine quantitative and qualitative methods to obtain a richer understanding of investigated phenomena. From quantitative methods, I have experience with standard econometric techniques, quantitative text analysis, in particular, structural topic modelling. My research also draws from interviews and focus groups.

I obtained my MA degree in Public Policy, with specialisation in Media, Communication and Information Policy from the Central European University. Before returning to academia, I worked in the civil society sector in Slovakia.
