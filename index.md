# Welcome to the Barefoot Ecologist's Toolbox
The Barefoot Ecologist's Toolbox website will include a number of applications and tools for exploring data and analysis, simulation of various aspects of a fishery, and estimation of parameters.

The site is still under construction.

## Applications 

Currently only an early version of the length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR) assessment method for data-limited fisheries is available.

Help information and other supporting material is not yet complete. More applications and material coming soon.
