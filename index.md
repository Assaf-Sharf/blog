# Objective:

Iâ€™m Tomoe Gusberti. For quite a while, I have been playing the role of a scientific advisor, providing data science/data analysis services to many sectors worldwide. 

I am a seasoned scientific consultant supplying data analysis services with R and Python. By tackling a variety of issues and projects in my career, I have extended my knowledge beyond what I learnt in formal education. My applications of this background have spanned both industrial and academic spheres, in the capacity of Quality manager of a biotech startup company, researcher, and most recently, as a scientific consultant. Through having a variety of experience, I have developed the skill of recognizing the big picture of a problem before delving into the details of the question through examining different data sources.

Thanks for taking the time to check out this page.

I have put together projects and code examples on this page that are meant to enhance the other content I have available online.
