The Decentralized Identity [un]Hackathon is an open event for people to learn,
collaborate, and think creatively about how this technology can be leveraged to
improve digital interactions in the future. This event is designed to be
inclusive to individuals from all backgrounds no matter their technical skills,
professional experience or familiarity with decentralized identity. Participants
in the [un]hackathon will be provided with resources and tools to interact with
concepts such as Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers
(DIDs), and work solo or in teams on potential use cases and prototypes. By
creating a fun learning experience for anyone interested in decentralized
identity, we hope to spread awareness and grow adoption of DIDs and VCs to
ensure that the future internet embraces identity ownership at its core.

This will be a virtual event that will take place in March. We will provide an online
event space for individuals to learn and collaborate on solutions using
decentralized identity technology.
