I am geophysical fluid dynamicist who is interested in turbulent environments in geophysical
boundary layers (both oceanic and atmospheric). In particular my main foci are small- and
submeso-scale turbulence, which I investigate with a numerical approach (usually large-eddy
simulations). I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland's Atmospheric
and Oceanic Science department in [Dr. Jacob Wenegrat](https://wenegrat.github.io/)'s group.
