## Overview
iGOS++ and I-GOS are perturbation-based attribution maps that utilize integrated gradients. 
For a quick start on the code, please refer to the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/khorrams/IGOS_pp).
   
## Intended Use
iGOS++ assumes a black-box model for generating saliency maps and can generate
explanations at arbitrary resolutions -- low resolution masks generate a coarse
explanation while high-resolution masks provide a fine-grained explanation over 
the input space. We believe iGOS++ can provide informative explanations to a wide
range of users when a black-box classifier is available. This includes subject matter 
experts who want to utilize XAI to find some interesting features from deep networks, 
developers who want to debug their black-box model to unveil errors in their data, etc.
As an example, we showcase the capabilities of iGOS++ in debugging a COVID-19 classifier on chest X-ray images.
   
## Model/Data
In our experiments, commonly-used ImageNet classifiers such as [VGG-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)
and [ResNet-50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) are used. For the COVID-19 experiment on chest X-ray images,
[COVID-Net](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net) has been used.
   
## Limitations
Since our method integrates the gradient on the path from the original image to a baseline, 
we have noticed our method does not work well when the model's prediction confidence 
is very low or when the classifier makes a wrong prediction.
