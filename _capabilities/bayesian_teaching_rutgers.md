title: "Bayesian Teaching for XAI (Rutgers)"
excerpt: "Producing explanations, and learning from explanations, depend on cooperative inference, where a teacher and a learner collaborate to help the learner achieve a more accurate understanding. We have primarily studied Explainable AI (XAI) as a Bayesian Teaching problem in the formalism of cooperative inference. In this collected body of works we show how cooperative inference solves a number of theoretical and practical problems in XAI."

## Overview
(What is the main purpose of the contribution?) Provide a human-centered framework for XAI based on cognitive science; showcase the framework’s applicability in domains such as image classification and medical diagnosis; extend the theoretical framework rigorously.

## Intended Use
(What is the intended use case for this contribution?) Establish the Bayesian Teaching framework; provide prototypical examples of the framework’s application to generate explanations; describe empirical approach to validate the explanations.

(What domains/applications has this contribution been applied to?) Image classification: emotion from facial expression, imagenet categories, pneumothorax diagnosis from X-rays.
