## Overview
We propose this new explanation framework to generate explanations from functional and mechanistic perspectives. The robot system learns from human demonstration and applies it to unseen tasks (e.g. opening a bottle). Visualizations of the robotâ€™s internal decisions are more effective in promoting human trust than explanations based on summary text explanations. The contribution contains loosely coupled modules in a code base.
  
## Intended Use
The robot system not only shows the ability to learn from human demonstrators but also succeeds in opening new, unseen bottles.

The proposed framework is applicable to autonomy domain.
