## Overview
For each Stakeholder group, the Playbook lists their Explanation Requirements, their Requirements for Information Access, and one or more Cautions that the designers of AI/XAI systems should be aware of.

## Intended Use
The purpose of the Stakeholder Playbook is to enable system developers to appreciate the different ways in which stakeholders need to "look inside" of the AI/XAI system.

## Limitations
Further empirical study via additional interviews with diverse stakeholders is desirable.
