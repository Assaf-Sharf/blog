## PhD research
My doctoral thesis, supervised by Dr Heinz Brandenburg and Dr Zachary Greene, explores the impacts of both FOI laws and open data on corruption using comparative cross-country approach. I proposed a theoretical framework which specifies conditions necessary for FOI laws and open data to affect corruption levels, and I tested it on a novel cross-country dataset which I collated for the thesis. The results suggest that the effects of both FOI laws and open government data on corruption are conditional upon the quality of media freedom. Moreover, other factors, such as free and fair elections, independent and accountable judiciary or economic development, are far more critical for tackling corruption than increasing access to information. In addition to comparative cross-country analysis, I used a case study approach to obtain in-depth insights into the public demand for government information and how people engage with it. To do so, I combined expert survey, semi-structured interviews with civic activists and civil servants and quantitative text analysis applied to FOI requests sent to the UK central government from 2008 to 2017.
