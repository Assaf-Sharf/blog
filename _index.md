# Updates

Last updated: 07/08/2023

I’ve been working on a few exciting things in the last few months. But most recently, I am trying to enjoy this warm summer weather.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- My team and I have rebuilt our entire market data pipeline in Rust. Rust is the best programming language known to man.
- I’ve built out my own product, [Neural Canopy](https://neuralcanopy.com/), an AI prompt template. I am still working on it and appreciate any feedback.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- I’ve started training Muay Thai and a bit of BJJ. I miss combat sports and I thought I would enjoy BJJ more than striking, but there's something about throwing a combination and having it land that feels just right.
- I’ve also started coaching high school wrestling on Sundays. This has been something I’ve wanted to do for years. I am very happy to have taken the leap.
