# Bi-Weekly Updates: 03/01/22 - 03/15/22

These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I've been interviewing at a few places, learning new things, reading, and focusing on my health.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- [**Mastery**](/categories/mastery) **-** I have finished re-reading one of my favorite books, _Mastery_ by Robert Greene. The last chapter has strung a chord with me. I am creating various posts on [_Mastery_](/categories/mastery) to further explore its meaning and implications on my own life.

- [**Mentorship Program**](/categories/career/mentorship_program) - I've started a **free** mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.

- **New Role -** I have taken up a new role in the blockchain space. I will be working on a new layer two blockchain. I am incredibly excited about this opportunity.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- **Health and wellness -** I have immersed myself in the "human" sciences over the last few weeks. Two podcasts that have been particularly interesting to me have been the ["Lifespan" podcast by Dr. Sinclair](https://www.abdulrabbani.com/categories/learning/podcast/lifespan) and the ["Huberman Lab" podcast by Dr. Huberman](https://www.abdulrabbani.com/categories/learning/podcast/huberman_lab).

  - I've enjoyed learning more about health and wellness. It's an incredibly fascinating topic. I've also been implementing new protocols in my day-to-day life.

  - Over the last few weeks, I've been doing a 22 hour fast, and I love it. I get a bit hungry 2 hours before it's time to eat, but it's taking time for my body to adjust its new Ghrelin secretion cycles.

  - I've also started to read more scientific journals. I've subscribed to "Nature," one of the leading scientific journals. This has led me to check things that I hear and believe by seeking out the scientific literature.

- **Learning Albanian** - I am still [learning Albanian](/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian), it's not easy, but it's been gratifying. I love speaking to my partner in her native tongue and trying to string together sentences.
