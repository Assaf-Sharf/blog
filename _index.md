# Looking for an Engineer?

If you are looking to hire a skillful and versatile software engineer, look through my [experiences](/categories/career/technical_experience/technical_experience_overview) and determine if I am a good fit for your search. I am currently looking to work as a developer. Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:abdulrabbani00@gmail.com).

# Currently in Progress

Check out some of the personal projects that I am currently working on. I am working in the following [categories](/categories): [math](/categories/math), [art](http://127.0.0.1:4000/categories/art/), and [literature](/categories/literature/).

## Math

I am currently learning [linear algebra](/categories/math/linear_algebra). Here, I go over important concepts within the topic. I focus more on fundamental ideas over computation, because these ideas are applicable to other fields and subjects.

## Art and Literature

I have also taken an interest in [drawing](/categories/art/drawing/) and [poetry](/categories/english/poetry/). These fields are not my strong suit, but I am doing my best to expand my knowledge.
