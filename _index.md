# Currently in Progress

Check out some of the personal projects I am currently working on  [categories](/categories).

## Math

I am currently learning  [linear algebra](/categories/math/linear_algebra), here I am going over important concepts within the topic. I am focusing more on fundamental ideas over computation, as the ideas are carried over to other fields and subjects.

## Art and Literature

I have also taken an interest in  [drawing](/categories/art/drawing/)  and  [poetry](/categories/english/poetry/). These fields are certainly not my strong suit, but I am doing my best to expand my knowledge and reach.
