# Bi-Weekly Updates

These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I've been interviewing at a few places, learning new things, reading, and focusing on my health.

- **Health and wellness -** I have immersed myself in the "human" sciences over the last few weeks. Two podcasts that have been particularly interesting to me have been the ["Lifespan" podcast by Dr. Sinclair](https://www.abdulrabbani.com/categories/learning/podcast/lifespan) and the ["Huberman Lab" podcast by Dr. Huberman](https://www.abdulrabbani.com/categories/learning/podcast/huberman_lab).

  - I've enjoyed learning more about health and wellness. It's an incredibly fascinating topic. I've also been implementing new protocols in my day-to-day life.

  - Over the last few weeks, I've been doing a 22 hour fast, and I love it. I get a bit hungry 2 hours before it's time to eat, but it's taking time for my body to adjust its Ghrelin secretion.

  - I've also started to read more scientific journals. I've subscribed to "Nature," one of the leading scientific journals. This has led me to check things that I hear and believe by seeking out the scientific literature associated with it.

- **Mastery -** I'm re-reading one of my favorite books, "Mastery" by Robert Greene. The last chapter has strung a chord with me. I am getting so much more out of the book the second time around.

  - "The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift." - Albert Einstein.

  - I am working to understand the intuitive mind better and make the most of my gift.

- **Learning Albanian** - I am still [learning Albanian](/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian), it's not easy, but it's been gratifying. I love speaking to my partner in her native tongue and trying to string together sentences.

- **Learning Javascript -** It's been long enough that I shied away from learning JS. I've recently learned JS (ES6). Next up is learning more about the entire ecosystem, including but not limited to nodeJS, Typescript, and React.

  - I honestly did not think I would enjoy JS as much as I did. I initially wanted to stay as far away as I could from front-end development. But the closer I get to it, the more I enjoy it. This experience has been a great reminder not to be married to your beliefs, especially since most are outdated.
