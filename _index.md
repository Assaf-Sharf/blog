# Bi-Weekly Updates: 04/02/22 - 04/16/22

These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I've been interviewing at a few places, learning new things, reading, and focusing on my health.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

-   [**Mentorship Program**](https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/career/mentorship_program "/categories/career/mentorship_program") - I've started a **free** mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.
    
    -   This last week I had a seminar with the engineering team at Asaadhub. I had a great time talking with the team and sharing my ideas.
        
-   **Cerc -** I started working at Cerc, where I am developing their core technology written in Golang. I am gaining a lot of knowledge into `geth` (`go-ethereum`) and other nifty projects in the crypto space.
    
    -   I have also started working on the `lighthouse`—an open-source client for Ethereum’s Beacon chain.
        

## Personal

A few personal updates:

-   **Health and wellness -** I am almost done reading the Omnivores Dilemma, and it has been incredibly eye-opening. The book highlights our relationship with food and how it has been grown. Over the last few weeks, I have made a more significant effort to be more mindful of the things I put into my body. I have primarily been eating vegetables (that I put in my ninja air fryer) and grass feed meats.
    
-   **Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography by Theodore Roosevelt -** I am reading President Roosevelt’s autobiography, and I must say, it is genuinely marvelous. President Roosevelt was a true gentleman with a kind heart and a strong moral compass. He has also lived a full life, which is what I am currently reading.
