# Bi-Weekly Updates: 03/19/22 - 04/02/22

These last few weeks have been quite interesting for me. I've been interviewing at a few places, learning new things, reading, and focusing on my health.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- [**Mastery**](https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/mastery "/categories/mastery") **-** I have finished re-reading one of my favorite books, _Mastery_ by Robert Greene. The last chapter has strung a chord with me. I am creating various posts on [_Mastery_](https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/mastery "/categories/mastery") to further explore its meaning and implications on my own life.

- [**Mentorship Program**](https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/career/mentorship_program "/categories/career/mentorship_program") - I've started a **free** mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.

  - This last week I had a seminar with the engineering team at Asaadhub. I had a great time talking with the team and sharing my ideas.

- **Cerc -** I started working at Cerc, where I am developing their core technology written in Golang. I am gaining a lot of knowledge into `geth` (go-ethereum) and other nifty projects in the crypto space.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- **Health and wellness -** I am almost done reading the Omnivores Dilemma, and it has been incredibly eye-opening. The book highlights our relationship with food and how it has been grown. Over the last few weeks, I have made a more significant effort to be more mindful of the things I put into my body. I have primarily been eating vegetables (that I put in my ninja air fryer) and grass feed meats.

- **Learning Albanian** - I am still [learning Albanian](https://abdurabbani00.atlassian.net/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian "/categories/learning/languages/learning_albanian"), it's not easy, but it's been gratifying. I love speaking to my partner in her native tongue and trying to string together sentences.
