The Biomedical Commons Cloud (BCC) is cloud-based infrastructure that provides secure, compliant cloud services for managing and analyzing genomic data, electronic medical records (EMR), medical images, and other PHI data.  It provides resources to researchers so that they can more easily make discoveries from large complex controlled access datasets.  The BCC provides resources to those institutions in the BCC Consortium.   It is an example of what is sometimes called condominium model of sharing research infrastructure in which the research infrastructure is operated by a consortium of educational and research organizations and provides resources to the consortium.   
<br>
CDIS is collaborating with the Open Cloud Consortium, which is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, on this project providing cloud based infrastructure supporting data scientists.

### What are the some of the main goals of the BCC?

The BCC will bring together a critical mass of data and research infrastructure that would be difficult to do for any one its member working individually.
<br>
<br>
The BCC will design and test technical standards so that the BCC can interoperate with other national and international biomedical clouds, including testing
<br>
<br>
•	APIs to access and query data in the BCC
<br>
<br>
•	Developing infrastructure so that the BCC can interoperate with Amazon, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure public cloud platforms.
<br>
<br>
•	Data synchronization between two biomedical clouds
<br>
<br>
•	Technology to scatter queries to multiple biomedical clouds and gather the results
<br>
<br>
•	Coordinated analysis across biomedical clouds
<br>
<br>
The BCC will also experiment with sustainability models so that multiple institutions can work together to build a cloud-based infrastructure that would not be easy for any of them to build alone in a sustainable fashion.

### Who operates the BCC?

The Biomedical Commons Cloud (BCC) is cloud-based infrastructure operated by the not-for-profit Open Cloud Consortium.    The University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins University, will be collaborating to set up and operate the BCC.  Other Universities and medical research centers are expected to join over the next year.

### Why is there a need?

Today, only a handful of research institutions can operate the computing infrastructure need to manage and analyze the large datasets available to the research community.   The BCC is a mechanism for multiple research organizations to work together to build a critical mass of data and research infrastructure that would not be practical for them to build individually.
