The Center for Data Intensive Science (CDIS) in the Biological Sciences Division at the University of Chicago is a recently created center focused on data science and its applications to problems in biology, medicine, and health care.
<br>
<br>
The open-source software environment that has been developed by CDIS scientists supports each of these four projects.

## [Genomic Data Commons (GDC)]({{site.url}}/projects/gdc)
The GDC hosts cancer genomics data produced by research projects funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and makes the data available to researchers around the world.  This project is funded by a $36M, four year contract with the NIH/NCI that was awarded to the University of Chicago in May 2014.
<br>
<br>

## [Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud (PDC)]({{site.url}}/projects/pdc)
The PDC is the first open-source, cloud-based computational platform that allows researchers authorized by NIH to compute over human genomic data in a secure and compliant fashion.  Bionimbus and related cloud-based infrastructures are used by researchers working on cancer, diabetes, and neuropsychiatric disorders.   This project is funded in part by a NIH/NCI contract that was awarded in 2013 and by an anonymous gift.

## [Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC)]({{site.url}}/projects/osdc)
OSDC is a large-scale science cloud started in 2009 that makes large datasets and cloud-computing infrastructures available to data scientists around the world.  This project is primarily funded by the Moore Foundation and the National Science Foundation.

## [Biomedical Commons Cloud (BCC)]({{site.url}}/projects/bcc)
BCC is a new Open Cloud Consortion (OCC) project allowing university, medical research centers, and companies to jointly leverage private, secure compliant clouds operated by the OCC within the context of a larger, commercial open ecosystem to facilitate discoveries in biology, medicine, and healthcare.
