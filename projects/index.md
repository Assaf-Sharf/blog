## Minimal Mistakes

I built this site built on [Github](http://github.com), supported by the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) using [Michael Rose's](https://mademistakes.com) [Minimal Mistakes project](http://github.com/mmistakes).

Minimal Mistakes now requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 2.2+. Make sure to run `gem update jekyll` if you aren't on the latest version or `gem install jekyll` if this is your first time installing it.

If you are creating a new Jekyll site using Minimal Mistakes follow these steps:

1. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork).
2. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
3. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
4. Update `config.yml`, add navigation, and replace demo posts and pages with your own. Full details below.

If you want to use Minimal Mistakes with an existing Jekyll site follow these steps:

1. [Download Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/archive/master.zip) and unzip.
2. Rename `minimal-mistakes-master` to something meaningful ie: `new-site`
3. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
4. Remove demo posts/pages and replace with your own posts, pages, and any other content you want to move over.
5. Update posts' and pages' YAML to match variables used by Minimal Mistakes. Full details below.
6. Update `_config.yml` and add navigation links. Full details below.
