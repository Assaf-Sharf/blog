## Minimal Mistakes (2014)

I built this site on [Github](http://github.com), supported by the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) using [Michael Rose's](https://mademistakes.com) [Minimal Mistakes project](http://github.com/mmistakes), powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 2.2+. You can find out more about it by reading the post on this site or you can visit the original project mentioned above.
