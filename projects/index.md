The Center for Data Intensive Science (CDIS) in the Biological Sciences Division at the University of Chicago is a recently created center focused on data science and its applications to problems in biology, medicine and health care.
<br>
<br>
The open source software environment developed by CDIS scientists supports each of these four projects.

## [Genomic Data Commons (GDC)]({{site.url}}/projects/gdc)
The Genomic Data Commons (GDC), which hosts cancer genomics data produced by research projects funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and makes the data available to researchers around the world.  This is funded by a $36M four year NIH/NCI contract that was awarded to the University of Chicago in May, 2014.

## [Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud (PDC)]({{site.url}}/projects/pdc)
The Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud (PDC), which is the first open-source cloud-based computational platform that allows researchers authorized by NIH to compute over human genomic data in a secure and compliant fashion.  Bionimbus and related cloud-based infrastructure is used by researchers working on cancer, diabetes and neuropsychiatric disorders.   This is funded in part by a NIH/NCI contract that was awarded in 2013 and by an anonymous gift.

## [Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC)]({{site.url}}/projects/osdc)
Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC), which is a large scale science cloud started in 2009 that is primarily funded by the Moore Foundation and the National Science Foundation and makes large datasets and cloud computing infrastructure available to data scientists around the world.

## [Biomedical Commons Cloud (BCC)]({{site.url}}/projects/bcc)
Biomedical Commons Cloud (BCC), which is a new OCC project so that universities, medical research centers and companies can jointly leverage private secure compliant clouds operated by the OCC within the context of a larger commercial open ecosystem to facilitate discoveries in biology, medicine and health care.
