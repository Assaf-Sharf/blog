The son of a movie-poster painter in China, Wayne Chin was destined to be an outstanding artist.  Wayne has over 25 years of experience in fine art, including oil portrait, landscape oil painting, sculpture, advertising and graphic art.  He is also a professional illustrator for architecture and graphic design.  His expression techniques range from fluid, conceptual sketches to crisp, formal renderings.  Complete presentations by Wayne can be provided in a variety of media such as pen and ink, colored pencil, colored marker, egg tempera and water color.

Wayne Chin maintains his studio in Vancouver, Washington.  One of the city's most accomplished portrait painters, Wayne photographs his subjects first, then does both black-and-white and color thumbnail sketches before putting brush to canvas.
