Battery management system for up to 15 Li-ion cells based on bq76940 or bq76930 IC from Texas Instruments

The current version is stil based on the AVR ATmega328p and thus, Arduino-compatible. The future versions will be based on the 32-bit STM32F072 MCU, as the MPPT charge controller.

## Features

- Up to 15 Li-ion cells (e.g. LiFePO4)
- Current approx. 50A (terminals allow only 32A so far)
- FDMT80080DC as CHG and DSG FETs (same as new SBMS100 from Dacian Todea)
- High-side switches using new TI BQ76200 --> no problems with ground offsets for CAN communiction etc. anymore.
- Possibility of pre-charging the 48V bus before switching on the battery.
- Balancing current approx. 150 mA

## Development

The BMS is under active development and you are welcome to participate.

For the next hardware revision, a separation between controls and power part is planned. Thus, the battery protection MOSFETs and the current measurement will be on a separate PCB with high copper thickness. This power switch part can also be used as a battery protection for e.g. lead-acid batteries.
