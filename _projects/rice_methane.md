## Project

Rice cultivation accounts for 11% of the anthropogenic emission of methane, a
potent greenhouse gas. Breeding rice that produces less methane could reduce the
human contribution to global warming. We have identified rice cultivars which
emit less methane but their yields are  not as high as conventional varieties.
By understanding how low methane cultivars influence their microbial communities
we can select just the relevant low methane traits, breeding cultivars that also are
productive, disease resistant and have desirable grain properties.
