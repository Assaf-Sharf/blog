## Project

In 2017 the US poultry industry hatched 800 million eggs to produce hens for
egg laying. Egg laying breeds are not used for meat production so male chicks
are culled at 1-2 days of age. By developing methods to determine the sex
of an egg early in development, eggs containing male embryos can be culled
before the embryo can sense pain, increasing animal welfare.

Our approach uses machine learning to classify eggs as early as day 1 in
development. We have entered the FFAR Egg-Tech grant challenge.
