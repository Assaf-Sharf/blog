## Project

The US poultry industry hatches about 800 million eggs a year to produce hens for
egg laying. Egg laying breeds are not used for meat production so male chicks
are culled at 1-2 days of age. By developing methods to determine the sex
of an egg early in development, eggs containing male embryos can be culled
before the embryo can sense pain, increasing animal welfare. Early sexing
also reduces industry costs.

Our approach uses high speed Volatiles mass spectrometry and machine learning
to classify eggs as early as day 3 in development.


We recently purchases an Ionicon PTR-TOF 1000 Ultra  Proton Transfer Reaction
Mass Spectrometer are actively developing other applications for PTR-MS in agriculture
including animal disease management and the processing of agricultural commodities.
