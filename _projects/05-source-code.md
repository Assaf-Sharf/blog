Source code of artificial mind is 100% dynamic. That's mean it's impossible to keep it in the traditional form of source code.  
All source code with all data is kept in databases and is constantly changing.

The unchangeable parts are tools like:

- database server
- admin control panel
- scripting system

**22-02-14** At current stage of project all source is static like traditional programs. It will change, when development of project Extended AM will start.
