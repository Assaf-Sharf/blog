## Project

Viruses are important drivers of ecosystem dynamics, nutrient turnover and
disease.  While the role of viruses in disease is well studied, their roles in
ecosystems are becoming more apparent through increased metagenomic surveys. The
growing amount of metatranscriptome and metagenome data present the opportunity
to find new, highly divergent RNA and DNA viruses. However, identifying highly
divergent viruses requires moving beyond traditional homology based search.  We
are developing a classifier for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic contigs that
takes information from across the feature spectrum and jointly trains wide
logistic regression and deep feed-forward neural network models to identify new
viruses with little homology to existing viruses.
