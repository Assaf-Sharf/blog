Each project is created according to the same rules and principles. A common description of all projects is given below.
{: .notice--info}

## Idea

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/idea.png" alt="idea" %}

This stage determines whether the project is possible to implement according to available:

- technology
- knowledge
- experience

The implementation of the idea at the level of 90-100% means that the project is literally possible to create according to current possibilities.

All projects are based on:

- research on the human mind
- pioneering knowledge (**not** based on current science), in the form of:
  - Philosophy
  - Psychology
  - Logic

## Design

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/design.png" alt="design" %}

Due to the fact that these are pioneering projects, it is impossible to define what is the so-called **version 1.0**.

This means that projects must be designed according to the rule:

- `minimum`

Without this rule, projects would be created infinite.

## Development

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/development.png" alt="development" %}

The project is implemented in ASAP mode (as fast as possible).
This means that everything that is possible to omit is omitted:

- optimization
- tests that are not needed
- documentation
