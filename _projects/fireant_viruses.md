## Project

The red imported fire ant, *Solenopsis invicta* Buren is an invasive species
native to South America.  The ant was introduced into the United States in the
1930s where damage and control efforts cost an estimated $6 billion annually.
Population studies on the two continents have shown that fire ant populations
are significantly greater, found in higher densities, possess larger mound
volumes, and comprise a larger fraction of the ant community in infested areas
within the U.S. These inter-continental disparities support the hypothesis that
*S. invicta* likely escaped its natural enemies during U.S. founding events.
Indeed, direct evaluations have shown a paucity of natural enemies in founding
populations of *S. invicta*.

Despite the known usefulness of viruses to control
insect pests, viruses have been only recently investigated for use against ants.
We are using metagenomics and next generation sequencing to discover new virus
natural enemies of the fire ant in its native range with the goal of testing and
releasing new viral pathogens into U.S. *S. invicta* populations to provide
natural, sustainable control of this ant.
