New statistical methods make genotyping faster and more cost effective

## Collaborators

* Chip Hunter - USDA-ARS CMAVE, Gainesville, FL

## Project

Mutant libraries are made using transposon insertion mutagenesis.  Many of these
have been characterized but in breeding it is necessary to determine if the mutation is
wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous. This is often done with qPCR but the
process is time-consuming and expensive.  We are working with Chip Hunter to
develop the statistical methods and software to pull down the mutation sites
and sequence them in parallel. The project has required us to apply new
statistical methods for the analysis of compositional count data to
 accurately predict genotype.
