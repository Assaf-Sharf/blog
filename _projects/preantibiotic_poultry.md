## Project
Antimicrobial resistance genes are prevalent in agricultural animals life today.
It is assumed that antimicrobial resistance genes were scarce in
pre-antimicrobial days, but testing this assumption has been difficult.

We are collaborating with the Smithsonian institution to deep sequence the cecal
contents of poultry preserved in alcohol and compare them to modern poultry. Our
first sample came from a ~5 week old chick collected in 1872.  The collection
has over 600,000 birds in liquid, however most of them  are tropical birds
from far-flung places. There were very few domestic chickens preserved and most
of them were from the Museum's collection of birds with developmental
deformities. Our first sample was labeled "Double Brained Chicken - 1872".
