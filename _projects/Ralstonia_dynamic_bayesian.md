# Project

We are  develop probabilistic graphical models of bacterial-fungal-plant
interactions using metagenomic and polar exometabolite data. The experiment exposed resistant (line H7996) and susceptible
(line FL8000) tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) to the select agent soil pathogen
Ralstonia solanacearum (RS5) which is responsible for Bacterial Wilt (Figure 1).
 R. solanacearum infects plants through root wounds and colonizes vascular
 tissues. The pathogen rapidly multiplies and clogs the xylem vessels causing
  the infected plant to quickly wilt and die. Exopolysaccharides from
  R. solanacearum activate salicylic acid (SA) pathways in the resistant
  plants, but not in susceptible plants
  (Mansfield et al., 2012; Milling et al., 2011). A recent study suggested
  the microbiome plays a role in host susceptibility (Kwak et al., 2018).
  The system is being used as a model for developing new techniques in modeling
  bacterial-fungal-plant interactions and developing statistical methods to 
  engineer microbial consortia from these graphical models.
