I used CartoDB to quickly map Bristol's council house auctions over the last 10 years. This enabled a better understand where, when, and how many council houses were  sold.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
 A colleague obtained through FOIA a list of the addresses and dates corresponding dates of council house auctions in Bristol. I ran this list through <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchGeocoding.php">a batch geocoder</a> to obtain the coordinates of the properties.
