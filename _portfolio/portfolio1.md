For this mini project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: [zeiss.com](https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html). The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X.

We pull some data from [data.nasdaq.com](https://data.nasdaq.com/).
