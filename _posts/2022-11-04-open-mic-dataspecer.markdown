During his Ph.D. studies at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the CHarles University, Štěpán has been developing a tool Dataspecer. It is meant for seamless creation and management of schemas for data-serialization formats. In the presentation he also takes into account how it can help organizations with open data publication and/or development of APIs for large microservice oriented projects.
