<p>A little over a year after cutting the sharing rate from 7% to 2.5%, Apple is discontinuing its affiliate program for the App Store found on its hardware running iOS and macOS.</p><p>The announcement was made on Apple's [official iTunes affiliate page](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/blog/affiliate-program-app-store-updates/), stating in both English and Japanese that the affiliate program will be removed from both the iOS and https://alternativeto.net/software/mac-app-store/'s apps and in-app content. The trillion-dollar company cited "increased methods of app discovery" from the updated https://alternativeto.net/software/app-store/ as the reason for retiring this program.</p><p>Though affiliates will no longer receive commission based on apps and in-app purchases, they will still be able to earn commission on customers that buy books, movies, music, and television shows from iTunes using their referral links.</p><p>Sites that sustain themselves of affiliate revenue, such as TouchArcade, [have written disparaging posts](https://toucharcade.com/2018/08/01/apple-kills-the-app-store-affiliate-program-and-i-have-no-idea-what-we-are-going-to-do/) following the move. Alternative revenue streams, such as affiliate links via Amazon and direct funding from users via https://alternativeto.net/software/patreon/, may be needed in the near future for sites of this kind.</p><p>Apple has set the cutoff date for its App Store affiliate program to October 1st, 2018.</p>
