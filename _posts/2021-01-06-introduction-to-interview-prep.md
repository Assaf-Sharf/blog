# Welcome to My Interview Prep Service

Are you currently interviewing with tech companies to find your next venture and having  
trouble finding employment? Are you finding that interviewing is far more difficult now with everything being remote? If this sounds like you, you can improve your chances of securing your dream job by becoming a better, more skilled interviewee. I, [Abdul Rabbani](/about), have had the pleasure of working at reputable companies such as Microsoft, and I have had the responsibility of interviewing potential candidates. I know what it takes to rise to the top of the candidate pool, and I want to share it with you.

Many people are finding that the job market is saturated with many great candidates, which makes the market place so much more competitive. In this competitive industry, small things like making a connection with a potential employer are crucial. This is why you need to find ways to stand out and show your strengths to interviewers while avoiding any red flags.

# Queue Interview Prep

As with anything, it is more beneficial to work smarter, not harder. By prepping for your interviews, you can improve your interviewing skills and make your way to the top of any candidate pool, for any company. [Learn more](https://arabbani-prep.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTS/pages/20742145/Interview-Prep%3A+What+is+Interview+Prep+and+Why+You+Need+It) about the benefits of interview prep, why you need it, and the best way to go about doing it.

## Finding Your Interview Coach

Michael Jordan had Phil Jackson, Tom Brady had Bill Belechek, Manny Pacquiao has Freddy Roach. All these great athletes are known for their amazing accomplishments, but this may not have been possible without their coaches. After all, Michael Jordan didn’t win his first ring until Phil Jackson came along. Without whom, Michael Jordan might not be hailed as the greatest basketball player of all time.

Just as Phil Jackson was crucial to the success of Michael Jordan, you need to find your own coach. Sure, you can shoot hoops on your own without anyone coaching you, but if the great Michael Jordan could benefit from  a coach, so can you.

When going through [interview prep](/interview_prep/what_is_interview_prep_and_why_you_need_it), you should look to [find the right interview coach](https://arabbani-prep.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTS/pages/20643907/Interview-Prep%3A+Finding+the+Right+Interview+Coach) for you. I can help you analyze your game, find holes, solutions, and make sure you are dunking those interviews with absolute ease.

## How Do I Do Interview Prep?

Once you learn what interview prep is  and you know how to find your interview coach, you might wonder, how does one exactly _do_ interview prep? Do I use flashcards? Do I do speed interviews? Should I practice in front of a mirror?

There are a few services that good interview coaches will provide you. Some generic services offer a “one size fits all” approach, but more than likely, that will not be right for you. Instead, you want an interview program tailored to your needs. You might want to improve your 3 point shot, so why be part of a program that will only help improve your defense?

Take a look at the [service I am providing](https://arabbani-prep.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTS/pages/20742300/Interview-Prep%3A+Services+Provide) to candidates such as yourself to help them drastically improve their interview game.

## Hiring Me as Your Coach

Once you’ve learned why you need an interview coach, you’ll need to find the right one. [Start here](/interview_prep/get_in_touch). As [someone](/about/) who has conducted dozens of interviews at Microsoft, I have a deep grasp of what interviewers are looking for in you. I can help you build a plan tailored to your needs, that will improve your interviewing skills.

# A Note for College Grads

As someone who has interviewed many college graduates, I have come to notice that many colleges are not successfully preparing their graduates for careers in technology. Technology grows and evolves rapidly. College curriculums, on the other hand, do not. Colleges are not including technologies being used in the workplace as part of their curriculum, which is negatively affecting their students. That is why, unfortunately, I have had to turn many college graduates down for a career at Microsoft.
