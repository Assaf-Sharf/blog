## Finding Your Interview Coach

Jordan had Greg Jackson, Tom Brady had Bill Belechek, Manny Pacquiao has Freddy Roach. All these great athletes and competitors are known for their amazing accomplishments, and so are their coaches. Jordan didn’t win his first ring until Greg Jackson came along, without whom, Michael Jordan might not be hailed as the greatest basketball player of all time.

Just as Greg Jackson was crucial to the success of Michael Jordan, you need to find your own coach. Sure, you can shoot hoops on your own without anyone coaching you, but if the great Michael Jordan could benefit from one, so can you.

# A Note for College Grads

As someone who has interviewed many college graduates, I have come to notice patterns in the curriculum that most colleges and universities are providing. Technology grows and evolves rapidly. College curriculums, on the other hand, don't. That is why, unfortunately, I have had to turn many college graduates down for a career at Microsoft.
