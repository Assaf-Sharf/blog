# One

Another day, another blogging engine.

This is a test post to see what it's like to write posts in markdown, via the github editor, for github pages.

I'm trying to change a single setting at a time so I can see what effect it has on the site on github. The documentation is great but there's a lot to learn. The first real page will be either a tutorial showing what I did to get the sit up and running or a Unity3d walkthrough.

I've got a lot of transcribed text laready doen for the Unity tutorial but it'll need to be massaged into markdown shape and have a few helpful images added. 

Got to try and make things look nice :)
