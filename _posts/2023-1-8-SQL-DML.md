## Learning about Data Manipulation Language (DML) in SQL and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Today, I learned how to manipulate data through MySQL.
There are 3 functions to manipulate data.

1) ```INSERT INTO table_name(column_list) VALUES (value_list to put in column_list)```

```INSERT``` is used when I want to put in a new value to the data table.

2) ```UPDATE table_name SET column_name = value WHERE condition;```

```UPDATE``` is used when I want to change the value in the data table to some other values.

3) ```DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;```

```DELETE``` is used when I want to delete certain value from the data table.


And I learned about how to find out the relationships between multiple tables of data using Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

Basically, all the tables have one primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK).

PK is a unique data in the table that only has one value, and FK is brought from other tables of data where that certain key is considered PK. 
FK can have multiple values. 

For example, in Orders table where OrderID is PK and CustomerID is FK, CustomerID key is brought from Customers table where CustomerID is PK. 

Also, there is a line that connects PK in one table to the same key that is FK in other tables. This line represents the cardinality, 
meaning the numerical attributes of the relationship between 2 entities or entity sets. The three main cardinal relationships are:

1) one-to-one relationship: one value associated with one other value

2) one-to-many-relationship: one value associated with many other values

3) many-to-many-relationship: group of values associated with other groups of values

For example, if Customers table and Orders table is one-to-many-relationship respectively, it means that one customer can have many orders.

### My code for today
I brought the hardest code from the practice problems that I did regarding DML:
```
Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. 
Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. 
The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. 
The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The query result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```
I learned to solve this problem in two different ways. 
First, I specified the value to delete through self join:
```sql
DELETE t1
FROM Person AS t1
    INNER JOIN Person AS t2 ON t1.email = t2.email
WHERE t1.id > t2.id
```
In this solution, doing inner join according to the same email makes the graph look like
```
           t1                       t2
+----+------------------+----+------------------+
| id | email            | id | email            |
+----+------------------+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com | 1  | john@example.com |
| 1  | john@example.com | 3  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  | 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com | 1  | john@example.com |
| 3  | john@example.com | 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+----+------------------+
```
From here, setting a condition as ```t1.id > t2.id``` would delete a row with an id that is higher.

Second solution can be solved with sub-query.

For my first attempt, I wrote:
```sql
DELETE FROM Person WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id)
                                    FROM Person
                                    GROUP BY email)
```
And I kept on getting this error message that says: "You can't specify target table for update in FROM clause".

So, I searched from the internet and found that I can't reference the table I used in an inner query. 
I needed to replace the reference table in the sub-query with another sub-query with ```(SELECT * FROM Person) p```.

As a final answer, I got:
```sql
DELETE FROM Person WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id)
                                    FROM (SELECT * FROM Person) p
                                    GROUP BY email)
```
In this solution, I used sub-query in WHERE statement to bring another table that is grouped by email that shows the minimum id for certain email.
```
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+

id is the only column that is shown as a table used for sub-query, and email column above is just for the reference.
```
By making the condition as to delete the row with the id that is not in the sub-query table, I was able to delete the row with id with 3.


Overall, the format of DML was easy, but applying those with sub-query was really hard for me. 
I need to practice writing sub-query to be able to apply DML. 
ERD was somewhat easy to understand for me, but this post will be a reference page for me look at later on to remind myself when I look at the diagram.
