Convictional allows you to automate payments from your trading partners through our integration with Apruve. 

To connect Apruve with your Convictional account:

* Go to Settings and select “Activate Apruve billing?”. Two extra fields will appear.
* Go to Apruve and copy your “merchant ID”, paste into field
* Go to Apruve and create, then copy your “API key”, paste into field

When you are done, it should look like this:

![payments](https://github.com/rogerkirkness/convictional-help/blob/master/assets/images/payments.png?raw=true)

While active, Convictional will issue invoices to your trading partners once a day for all orders that have 1. Not yet been billed and are 2. Completed, which means they have been shipped. 

Your trading partner can pay their invoice in Apruve, while you get paid after shipping. If you have any issues connecting, email support.

To disconnect Apruve, select "Activate Apruve billing?" again.
