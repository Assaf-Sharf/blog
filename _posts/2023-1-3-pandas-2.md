## Learning about Univariate and Bivariate Analysis and Visualizing Longitude and Latitude

Today, I did a review on how to manage and visualize data into a graph using the public data of commercial district in Seoul. 
I first learned a new skill of univariate and bivariate data analysis, and then learned how to visualize longitude and latitudes using scatterplot and the python library called "Folium".
And I also got to learn how to visualize the missing variables using missingno

### What I got to do today
With univariate data, I learned to use distplot using seaborn:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.distplot(data["category"])
# distplot to depict the variation in distribution

plt.axvline(data["category"].mean(), linestyle=":", color="r")
plt.axvline(data["category"].median(), linestyle="--")
sns.distplot(data["category"])
# Used axvline to show the vertical line expressing a certain category of a data.
```

For bivariate data, correlational analysis was used:

```python
corr = data.corr()
# Getting a correlational data as a table

mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=bool))
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap="Blues", mask=mask)
# Visualizing the correlational data with heatmap
# annot => showing the correlation coefficient
# cmap => color
# mask => making it whiter(more transparent) as the value approaches either 1 or -1

sns.regplot(data=data.sample(1000), x="category_A", y="category_B")
# Shows the scatterplot of the category_A and category_B from 1000 samples of a data, and also draws a regression line.
```

Then I learned how to visualize the missing values using missingno after downloading the library:
```python
import missingno as msno

msno.matrix(data)
# Creates a matrix
# A category that has more white spaces means that category has more missing values

msno.heatmap(data)
# Creates a heatmap
# Can find out the correlation coefficient between two variables in the presence of missing data.

msno.dendrogram(data)
# Creates a dendrogram
# Show possible correlations between missing values in certain columns using the tree of hierarchical clustering algorithm.
```

Then I visualized the longitude and latitude of commercial districts in Seoul through scatterplot and Folium:
```python
sns.scatterplot(data=data, x="longitude", y="latitude", hue="District_Name")
# The scatterplot plots the longitude and latitude of data to create a map, and it has different colors depending on the district.

import folium
# Have to download the library first

long = data["longitude"].mean()
lat = data["latitude"].mean()

m = folium.Map(location=[lat, long], zoom_start=12)
m
# zoom_start to zoom in the map as default

m = folium.Map(location=[lat, long], zoom_start=12)

folium.Marker(
    [37.60199, 127.084528], tooltip="Hans_Edu").add_to(m)

m
# By writing the exact [latitude, longitude], I can mark a specific place and label it by tooltip.

m = folium.Map(location=[lat, long], zoom_start=12)

for i in data.index[:100]:
    tooltip = data.loc[i, "Business_Name"] + " - " + data.loc[i, "Address"]
    lat = data.loc[i, "Latitude"]
    long = data.loc[i, "Longitude"]

    folium.CircleMarker(
        [lat, long], tooltip=tooltip, radius=3).add_to(m)

m
# Using for loop, I marked 100 places as "Business Name - Address" with a different type of marker called circle marker.
```

I was able to learn very fascinating skills using different libraries. However, as I dig into this more, I feel the need to understand more concepts of data analysis. 
Being able to only visualize data and being able to get a certain result from the visualized data are very different, and my goal is to be able to draw a result from the data, 
not just being able to write certain functions and codes using pandas.
