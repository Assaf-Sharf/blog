# My Approach
As an interview coach, I whole-heartedly believe in creating tailored solutions for every single client. While most places have a “one size fits all” approach, I believe that every client is unique in their needs, and requires individual attention. Instead of signing on as many clients as possible, I keep the number of clients I have to a limited number. This allows me to focus on your success, and once you land your dream jobs, I accept a new client.

Ultimately, I care more about your success than I do about making a profit. My goal is for you to not need my service. Furthermore, while I believe that nearly all candidates need an interview coach, that doesn’t mean I am the right interview coach for you. If I believe that I am not the best interview coach for you, I will come outright and say it. I believe that candidates should find the best interview coach for their needs, even if that isn’t me. The last thing I want to do is waste someone's time, including my own.

# My Key Services
I provide many services to potential clients. Each client will require specific services, and creating the perfect plan ultimately comes down to your needs.

## Mock Interviews
Performing mock interviews with clients is the first step in improving your interviewing game. A mock interview allows your interview coach, to gain insight on how you are performing during interviews. After analyzing your interviewing skills, your interviewing coach can better understand your needs and tailor a more custom approach.

### What's Included
* A 1-hour mock interview. This can be any type of interview that the client chooses (technical interview, coding challenge, systems design, etc), and the interview coach will design an interview for them.

* An in-depth summary and analysis of the interview. This summary will point out the strengths and weaknesses of a client. It will reference timestamps to the interview so that the client can understand the analysis first hand.

* Pattern assessment: As the client conducts more mock interviews with the interview coach, the coach will start to analyze patterns. These patterns might not be immediately noticeable, but after further examination, might give the candidate insight into mistakes they are subconsciously making.

### Cost
Price Point: $40 to $60

As a client is conducting more mock interviews, the interviews will start to become easier and clearer to decipher. The interview coach will also have less groundwork to do as a client starts to improve. Therefore, the more mock interviews a client conducts, the cheaper the cost becomes.

## Dissecting Interviews
While performing mock interviews will help the client gain confidence, and allow the interview coach to gain a better understanding of the client's strengths and weaknesses, ultimately, the interview coach must dissect these interviews. Dissecting interviews allows the interview coach to provide tailored feedback to the client, along with a gameplan for how the client can improve.

Interview coaches will not only dissect mock interviews. If clients are able to record interviews with potential employers and provide the interview coach with the recording, the interview coach can listen to those interviews as well and dissect them.

### What's Included
* An in-depth analysis of all mock interviews. Here the interview coach will be searching for reoccurring patterns, common mistakes, improvements, and strengths, with concrete examples from the candidate's interviews.

* A gameplan: This gameplan will provide exercises and guidance for the client so that they can resolve the mistakes they are making, and continue to leverage their strengths. This is crucial, as the entire point of having an interview coach, is so that they can identify and help you fix your mistakes.

* The interview coach will listen to a recording of your interview with a potential employer. After listening to this recording, the interview coach will provide the same services as explained above.

### Cost
Price point:

* [Mock interviews Only] - $30 to $45: This will vary for clients as some clients might require more hands-on work than others, and have more mock interviews to analyze.

* [Mock interviews and Potential Employer Interviews] - $50 - $60/hour: This includes the work for mock interviews only, as specified above. Your interview coach will also listen to all the interviews you provide to them that you had with potential clients. As the length of these provided interviews may vary, so will the price. This is something you can work out with your interview coach.

## Creating Custom Lesson Plans and Projects
As a candidate, you might be displaying excellent engineering skills, you might have the perfect attitude and energy, but you might be lacking core knowledge of crucial technology. Some roles might want a candidate who has your skills but also understands CI/CD very well, and that might be the reason you miss out on your dream job.

### What's Included
* Your interview coach will create an in-depth lesson plan for you with technologies and tools you may be lacking on. This will include links to resources such as Udemy courses, that you can take to further understand a specific concept.

* These lesson plans will be tailored to your needs. Two different clients might need to understand CI/CD, but the extent to which they need to learn them both might vary. Therefore both clients will receive 2 separate, custom-tailored lesson plans.

* A custom project for the client, this project will require the client to exercise the material they just learned from the lesson plan. This will help solidify their understanding and provide them with real-world knowledge.

* The interview coach will take a look at the progress of the project periodically, and provide feedback along the way. This feedback will tell the client where they are deviating from best practices, help them when they’re stuck, and ensure that the client is properly grasping the concept.

### Cost
Price Point: $20 - $35/technology

Depending on the depth of the lesson plan, and the involvement of the project(s), the price will vary. The price can be discussed and worked out with the interview coach.

## 1 on 1 Tutoring Sessions
There might be technologies that you have studied but are still failing to grasp the core concepts of. This can happen and oftentimes be very frustrating. When this does occur, you can schedule a 1 on 1 tutoring session which will, where the client and the interview coach can dig deep into questions you may have and help you fill in specific holes.

### What's Included
* The interview coach will review a list of questions that the client will provide beforehand. This will include in-depth examples that will help the client have a holistic view.

* The interview coach might require 2 sessions, one where they simply understand where the disconnect is, and the other where they help explain.

* Exercises and problems that the client and interview coach can go over together, with the interview coach providing deep knowledge on the functionality and technology.

### Cost
Price Point: $40 - $55

This price will vary for different clients depending on the level of help they need. After the first preliminary call, the interview coach can provide a more accurate price.
