# My Approach

As an interview coach, I whole-heartedly believe in creating tailored gameplan for every single client. While most places have a “one-size-fits-all” approach, I believe that every client is unique in their needs and requires individual attention. Instead of signing on as many clients as possible, I  limit the number of clients I have at the same time. This allows me to focus on your success, so you can land your dream job.

Ultimately, I care more about your success than I do about making a profit. My goal is for you to eventually not need my services. Furthermore, while I believe that nearly all candidates need an interview coach, that doesn’t mean I am the right interview coach for you. If I believe that I am not the best interview coach for you, I will tell you. I believe that candidates should find the best interview coach for their needs, even if that isn’t me. The last thing I want to do is waste someone's time, including my own.

# My Key Services

I provide many services to potential clients. Each client will require specific services, and creating the perfect plan ultimately comes down to your needs.

## Mock Interviews

The first step to improving your interviewing skills is participating in mock interviews. A mock interview allows me  to gain insight into how you are performing during interviews. After analyzing your interviewing skills, I can better understand your needs and tailor a more custom approach.

### What's Included

-   A 1-hour mock interview. This can be any type of interview that you choose (technical interview, coding challenge, systems design, etc), and I will design the interview.

-   An in-depth summary and analysis of the interview. This summary will point out your strengths and weaknesses. It will reference timestamps to the interview so that you can understand the analysis first hand.

-   Pattern assessment: As you perform more mock interviews with me, I will start to analyze patterns. These patterns might not be immediately noticeable, but after further examination, might give you insight into mistakes they are subconsciously making.


### Cost

Price Point: $40 to $60

As you are conducting more mock interviews, the interviews will start to become easier to analyze and learn from. I will also have less groundwork to do as you start to improve. Therefore, the more mock interviews you perform, the cheaper the cost becomes.

## Dissecting Interviews

While performing mock interviews will help you gain confidence, and allow me to gain a better understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, ultimately, I must dissect these interviews. By dissecting the interview, I can provide you with specific feedback, along with a game plan for how you can improve.

I will not only dissect mock interviews. If you are able to record interviews with potential employers and give me the recordings, I can listen to those interviews as well and dissect them.

### What's Included

-   An in-depth analysis of all mock interviews. Here, I will be searching for reoccurring patterns, common mistakes, improvements, and strengths, with concrete examples from your interviews.

-   A gameplan: This gameplan will provide exercises and guidance for you so that you can resolve the mistakes you are making  and continue to leverage your strengths. This is crucial. The point of having an interview coach is so that I can identify and help you **fix** your mistakes.

-   If you are comfortable with recording your interviews with employers, I will listen to a recording. After listening to this recording, I will provide the same services as explained above.


### Cost

Price point:

-   [Mock interviews Only] - $30 to $45: This will vary for clients as some clients might require more hands-on work than others, and have more mock interviews to analyze.

-   [Mock interviews and Potential Employer Interviews] - $50 - $60/hour: This includes the work for mock interviews only, as specified above. I will also listen to all the interviews you provide to me that you had with potential  employers. As the length of these provided interviews may vary, so will the price. This is something we can work out together.

### Creating Custom Lesson Plans and Projects

As a candidate, you might be displaying excellent engineering skills and great energy, but you might be lacking core knowledge of crucial technology. Some roles might want a candidate who has your skills but also understands CI/CD very well, and that might be the reason you miss out on your dream job.

### What's Included

-   I will create an in-depth lesson plan for you with technologies and tools you may be lacking knowledge in. This will include links to resources such as Udemy courses, that you can take to further understand a specific concept.

-   These lesson plans will be tailored to your needs. Two different clients might need to understand CI/CD, but the extent to which they need to learn them both might vary. Therefore, both clients will receive 2 separate, individualized lesson plans.

-   A custom project for you: this project will require you to exercise the material you just learned from the lesson plan. This will help solidify your understanding and provide you with real-world knowledge.

-   I will take a look at the progress of the project periodically  and provide feedback along the way. This feedback will tell you where you are deviating from best practices, help you when you’re stuck, and ensure that you are properly grasping the concept. This will also help me understand where you are struggling, and figure out the best way to help fill in the gaps.


### Cost

Price Point: $20 - $35/technology

Depending on the depth of the lesson plan and the involvement of the project(s), the price will vary. We can discuss and work the price out together.

## 1 on 1 Tutoring Sessions

There might be technologies that you have studied but are still failing to grasp. This can happen and can be very frustrating. When this does occur, you can schedule a 1 on 1 tutoring session, where you and I can investigate questions you may have and help you fill in gaps.

### What's Included

-   I will review a list of questions that you will provide beforehand, and provide an answer. This answer will include in-depth examples that will help you have a holistic view.

-   I might require 2 sessions, one where I simply understand where the disconnect is  and the other where I help explain.

-   Exercises and problems that you and I can go over together, with me providing deep knowledge on the functionality and technology.


### Cost

Price Point: $40 - $55

This price will vary for different clients depending on the level of help they need. After the first preliminary call, the interview coach can provide a more accurate price.
