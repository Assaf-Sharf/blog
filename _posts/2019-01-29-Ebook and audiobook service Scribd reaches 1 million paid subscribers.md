<p><p>Literature-focused service Scribd has announced that 1 million people have signed up for its paid service, with $9 a month allowing access to the site's entire library.</p>
<p>Announced via <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/one-million-subscribers" rel="nofollow">a post on Scribd's official blog</a>, Scribd Inc. CEO Trip Adler describes this milestone as &quot;a tipping point&quot; that proves the service is one &quot;that people want, need, and love.&quot; The post also gives some statistics, including a 40% year-over-year increase in subscriber base ever since launching its $9 a month unlimited subscription plan last year. This is in addition to an over 100% increase in users listening to audiobooks on the site.</p>
