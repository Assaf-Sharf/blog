Motorized 2-wheel transportation is pervasive in Cuba. They’re cheap, quick, and easy to maneuver around the crumbling roads. While the rumbling, diesel-retrofitted automobiles of the 50’s and 60’s are the sexy pinup models of Cuban transportation, it’s clear that motorcycles and scooters are the pragmatic choice.

Among motorcycles, 125cc four-strokes are most common overall. 250cc MZs are also common, while the 350cc Jawa is more rare. The occasional 100cc two-stroke chainsaw whizzes by. Out in the countryside, an Africa Twin rumbled by as part of a touring group and looked like a monster among the smaller Cuban bikes.

When it comes to new bikes, 125cc Suzukis are the clear favorite. The Chinese Ava Jaguar plug-in electric motorcycle is a surprisingly popular new motorcycle.

Nobody is too cool to ride on the back. It’s not uncommon to see a tattooed, punk-rock-styled Cuban on the back of a tiny scooter with his friend. You’ll occasionally see a family of four, including baby, squeezed onto one seat.

Every rider and passenger wears a half-helmet, likely as a legal requirement. Protective clothing such as jackets, pants, and boots are practically unheard-of. The days were quite hot, even in mid-March.

Among the Suzukis, MZs, Jawas, and Avas are the occasional older brand, such as the Russian Karpaty, and various unlabeled 2-stroke hackjobs. Sportbikes are very rare.

As with everything in Cuba, the motorcycles and their locations are obscenely photogenic.
