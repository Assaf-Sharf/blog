# Problems With the Interviewing Process

There is an incredibly high demand for talented engineers in the technical space, and there is also an abundance of exceptional engineers who are looking to fill those roles. Although, oftentimes these engineers have difficulties displaying the full arsenal of skill they possess to potential employers, leading them to doubt themselves, and present challenges when finding the right job.

The truth is, interviewers often times put less effort into the interviewing process than the candidates, which leads to them having high expectations from a candidate without presenting the right opportunity for that candidate to demonstrate their skills. Other times, the interviewers ask the right questions from candidates, but the candidates do not provide the answer in the way the interviewer wants. Therefore, it is up to you, the candidate to find a way to exhibit the skillset which the interviewer is looking for regardless of the circumstances.

## Having a Bad Interviewer
Have you ever been in an interview where it seems like the interviewer hasn't given much thought to the questions they are going to ask you? Does it seem like the questions they are asking you aren’t put together properly or they haven’t done a good job articulating them? Unfortunately, many interviewers sometimes fail to ask candidates the __right__ questions.

So what are the right questions? These are questions that allow the candidate to exercise their engineering skills to come up with the right solutions. This could come in the shape of a coding question, a systems design question, a debugging question, and in many other forms. What many interviewers fail to do is ask a question that will give the candidate the opportunity to display the skills that they're looking for.

## Having a Good Interviewer But Failing to Display Your Skills

While there are many unprepared interviewers in the industry today, there are also many great interviewers. These interviewers ask multi-faceted questions that come in various shapes and sizes. These questions allow the candidate to exercise their superb engineering skills to come up with an answer. But unfortunately, many engineers focus too much on the destination and less on the journey. For many interviewers, the answer isn’t as important as the thought process which leads the engineer there.

Many interviewers are looking for specific problem-solving skills from a candidate, which proves to them that this candidate has a great way of approaching challenges, working out a solution and that their skills can be applied anywhere.

There are various components to these skills and many ways to show them off. At the end of the day, giving the right answer shouldn’t be the goal, instead, the goal should be to exercise your engineering skills, to prove to your interviewer, that no matter what the problem is, you can find the right answer.

# What is Interview Prep

Knowing what interviewers are looking for is only half the battle, at the end of the day, you need to prepare yourself to display your skills. But how do you do that? What skills are interviewers looking for? How should you approach problems, how do you separate yourself from other candidates? Like with most things in life, perfect practice makes perfect.

Practicing for interviews is crucial if you want to increase your chances of landing your dream job. If you are getting rejected by employers that means that there are a few parts of your game that need improving. Why would you continue to interview with other potential employers without fixing the holes in your game and missing those opportunities?

Interview prep will allow you to practice for interviews with an interview coach, who will figure out what those holes are, and devise a gameplan for you to fix them. This way you are constantly improving as a candidate, instead of having the same skillset for each interview and expecting a different result.

## Stop Wasting Your Opportunities

Figuring out how to present your skills to interviewers is a daunting task, but you do not want to practice your interviewing skills in live interviews with potential employers. There are a few reasons for this:

1. Every interview you fail is an opportunity you missed, an opportunity you could have capitalized on with the right preparation. The opportunity you missed versus the offer you accept could be the difference of tens of thousands of dollars. Investing in interview prep can land you a higher paying job.

2. The people interviewing you are more than likely not going to point out your strengths and weaknesses. They are simply going to interview you and make a decision. Without knowing the mistakes you are making, you’re going to continue to make them, which will result in your missing more opportunities.

3. The more interviews that you fail, the lower your confidence will get, which could negatively impact your future interviews.

4. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. If you’re failing interviews constantly and aren't taking the time to identify, analyze, and fix your mistakes, then you shouldn't expect a different result for your next interview.


## The Job of An Interview Coach
Now that you know why you shouldn’t waste your opportunities with potential employers, you might wonder, what’s the best way to actually practice. As Vicent Lombardi once said, “Practice doesn’t make perfect, only perfect practice makes perfect.” Shooting a free throw with bad form for 8 hours a day won’t make you a good free throw shooter. Therefore, it's important to have a coach who can help you practice in the best, most efficient manner. Someone who can point out your errors, and help you fix them.

As someone who has conducted dozens of interviews for various positions and levels at Microsoft, I have a deep grasp of what it is that interviewers are looking for. There are various things that one can do to prepare for interviews. Learn more about how to [find the right interview coach](/interview_prep/finding_the_right_interview_coach) for you.

### 1. Mock interviews with a qualified interviewer
1. Sure, you can ask your friend to interview you, but at the end of the day, they are going to give you their best assessment, which might not coincide with that of an actual interviewer. Therefore, it is advised to have mock interviews with a qualified interviewing coach, who can give you a qualified assessment.

2. Mock interviews will help candidates get some jitters out of the way, along with gaining practice for interviews in an environment that won’t negatively affect their employment chances.

### 2. Going over Real And Mock Interviews
1. If you are able to record interviews that you are having with actual employers, then you should do so. Afterward, your interview coach can go over the interview and give you feedback.

2. After an interview (real or mock), candidates should have a separate session, where the interviewer points out things that the candidate is doing well, along with things that the candidate needs to work on.

3. This feedback is critical, as it will give you direct insight as to how you are performing under pressure. This will also give you insight into what you need to practice before your next real interview.

4. Finding these weaknesses in your game is necessary. __Do not__ go into the next interview until you have fixed the mistakes from your previous interviews.

  1. It is better to spend more time in practice, getting better, gaining confidence and improving, than it is to go into multiple interviews making the same mistakes, and failing every time.

### 3. Figuring out What Skills and Technologies You Need to Work On
1. As you interview you will learn that there are many tools and technologies that you have never heard of. While no interviewer is going to expect you to know every tool, they are going to expect you to know some of the more popular ones. Furthermore, they are going to like it if you know what the tool they are talking about does, even if you don’t have real-life experience with it.

2. A good interview coach will be able to figure out which skills and tools you are lacking knowledge on. Once they have decyphered that, they can put together lesson plans for you, so that you may fill those knowledge gaps, and be in a better position for the next interview

## The Cost of Not Having an Interview Coach
Investing in interview prep might seem like another cost, and you might wonder if it’s even worth it. If you’re constantly being rejected for positions, it’s crucial for you to learn the reason. If you don’t, you will continue to be rejected for the interviews that follow.

Therefore, you need to assess the real cost of hiring an interview coach. Although they might cost money up-front, they will help you capitalize on job prospects, and help you land your dream job. The salary difference between your dream job and the job you end up settling for could be in the tens of thousands, which is a monetary loss far greater than investing in an interview coach.

What is finding your next job, the place you might work at for years, worth? By hiring an interview coach, you invest in yourself, and you’re investing in your future. Isn’t it better to spend hours preparing for an interview, interviewing for a few positions that truly interest you, and receiving offers; Rather than, wasting interview after interview with no offers, and struggling to find your next venture?
