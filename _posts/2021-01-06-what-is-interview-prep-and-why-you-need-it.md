# Problems With the Interviewing Process

There is a high demand for talented engineers in the technical space,  but there is also an abundance of exceptional engineers looking to fill those roles. Often times, during interviews, many engineers struggle with properly demonstrating the skills they possess, which leads them to doubt themselves and to struggle with finding the right job.

Interviewers have high expectations for candidates, but they sometimes design poor interview questions that do not allow the candidate an opportunity to demonstrate their skills. Other times, the interviewers ask the right questions of candidates, but the candidates do not provide answers in the _way the interviewer wants._ Whether the interviewer is asking effective questions or not, it is up to you, the candidate, to find a way to exhibit the skillset the interviewer is looking for.

## Having a Bad Interviewer

Have you ever been in an interview where it seems like the interviewer hasn't given much thought to the questions they are asking you? Does it seem like the questions they are asking you aren’t put together properly or  like they are not articulating them well? Unfortunately, many interviewers sometimes fail to ask candidates the **right** questions.

So what are the right questions? These are questions that allow the candidate to exercise their engineering skills to come up with the right solutions. This could come in the shape of a coding question, a systems design question, a debugging question, and in many other forms.  Many interviewers fail to ask a question that will give the candidate the opportunity to display the skills that they're looking for.

In these situations, it's your responsibility to find a way to display your superb engineering skills. The challenge may be daunting, but there are several ways to display your skills, even when being asked bad questions.  To help the flow of the interview, you can ask the interviewer to elaborate, guide the questions to a familiar topic, or steer the conversation to questions of mutual interest. Techniques like these push the interviewer to ask you questions that allow you to display your arsenal of skills. Even if you have a bad interviewer, with the right techniques, you can still have a good interview.

## Having a Good Interviewer But Failing to Display Your Skills

While there are many unprepared interviewers, there are also many great interviewers. These interviewers ask multi-faceted questions that come in various shapes and sizes. These questions allow the candidate to exercise and to demonstrate  their superb engineering skills to come up with an answer. Unfortunately, many engineers focus too much on the destination and less on the journey. For many interviewers, the answer isn’t as important as the thought process which leads the engineer there.

Many interviewers are looking for specific problem-solving skills from a candidate, which shows them that this candidate has a great way of approaching challenges and working out a solution. They want to know that your problem-solving skills can be applied anywhere.

There are various components to these skills and many ways to show them off. Your goal isn’t necessarily to find the right answer, but, rather, to exercise your engineering skills and prove to your interviewer that you can find the solution, no matter what the problem is.

# What is Interview Prep

Now that you know some crucial aspects of what interviewers are looking for, you need to do the hard part: learn how to display your skills. But how do you do that? What skills are interviewers looking for? How should you approach problems? How do you separate yourself from other candidates? Like with most things in life, it requires practice.

If you want to increase your chances of landing your dream job, you need to practice for your interviews. If you are getting rejected by employers that means that you need to improve your game. Why would you continue to interview with other potential employers without fixing the holes in your game? Without fixing these holes, you will continue to make the same mistakes and employers will continue to turn you down.

Interview prep will allow you to practice for interviews with an interview coach who will figure out what those holes are, and devise a gameplan for you to fix them. This way, you are constantly improving as a candidate, instead of going to each interview with the same skillset and expecting a different outcome.

## Stop Wasting Your Opportunities

It is daunting to figure out how to present your skills to employers, but you do not want to practice your interview skills with potential employers. There are a few reasons for this:

1.  Every interview you fail is an opportunity you missed, an opportunity you could have capitalized on with the right preparation. The opportunity you missed versus the offer you accept could be the difference of tens of thousands of dollars. Investing in interview prep can land you a higher paying job.

2.  The people interviewing you are more than likely not going to point out your strengths and weaknesses. They are simply going to interview you and make a decision.  If you don’t know what mistakes you’re making, you’re going to continue making them, which will lead to more missed opportunities.

3.  The more interviews you fail, the lower your confidence will be, which may influence your performance in future interviews.

4.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. If you’re failing interviews constantly and aren't taking the time to identify, analyze, and fix your mistakes, then you shouldn't expect a different result for your next interview.

5.  Preparing for and attending interviews takes a lot of time and energy. It's best not to waste that time and energy, instead, you should maximize it by preparing properly.


## The Job of An Interview Coach

Now that you know why you shouldn’t waste your opportunities with potential employers, you need to know the best way to practice for interviews. As Vicent Lombardi, a great football coach, once said, “Practice doesn’t make perfect, only perfect practice makes perfect.” Shooting a free throw with bad form for 8 hours a day won’t make you a good free throw shooter. Therefore, it's important to have a coach who can help you practice in the best, most efficient manner. You need someone who can point out your errors and help you fix them.

As someone who has conducted dozens of interviews for various positions and levels at Microsoft, I have a deep grasp of what interviewers are looking for. There are various things that you can do to prepare for interviews. Learn more about how to [find the right interview coach](/interview_prep/finding_the_right_interview_coach) for you.

### 1. Mock interviews with a qualified interviewer

1.  Sure, you can ask your friend to interview you, but at the end of the day, they are going to give you _their_ best assessment, which might not coincide with that of an actual interviewer. Therefore, it is advised to have mock interviews with a qualified interviewing coach, who can give you a qualified assessment.

2.  Mock interviews will help candidates get some jitters out of the way, along with gaining practice for interviews in an environment that won’t negatively affect their employment chances.


### 2. Going over Real And Mock Interviews

1.  If you are able to record interviews that you are having with actual employers, then you should do so. Afterward, your interview coach can go over the interview and give you feedback.

2.  After an interview (real or mock), candidates should have a separate session, where the interviewer points out things that the candidate is doing well, along with things that the candidate needs to work on.

3.  This feedback is critical, as it will give you direct insight as to how you are performing under pressure. This will also give you insight into what you need to practice before your next real interview.

4.  Finding these weaknesses in your game is necessary. **Do not** go into the next interview until you have fixed the mistakes from your previous interviews.

    1.  It is better to spend more time in practice, getting better, gaining confidence, and improving, than it is to go into multiple interviews making the same mistakes, and failing every time.


### 3. Figuring out What Skills and Technologies You Need to Work On

1.  As you interview you will learn that there are many tools and technologies that you have never heard of. While no interviewer is going to expect you to know every tool, they are going to expect you to know some of the more popular ones. Furthermore, they are going to like it if you know what the tool they are talking about does, even if you don’t have real-life experience with it.

2.  A good interview coach will be able to figure out which skills and tools you are lacking knowledge on. Once they have decyphered that, they can put together lesson plans for you, so that you may fill those knowledge gaps, and be in a better position for the next interview.

## The Benefits of Having an Interview Coach

Investing in interview prep might seem like another cost, and you might wonder if it’s even worth it. If you’re constantly being rejected for positions, it’s crucial for you to learn the reason. If you don’t, you will continue to be rejected for the interviews that follow.

Therefore, you need to assess the real cost of hiring an interview coach. Although they might cost money up-front, they will help you capitalize on job prospects, and help you land your dream job. The salary difference between your dream job and the job you end up settling for could be in the tens of thousands, which is a monetary loss far greater than investing in an interview coach.

What is finding your next job, the place you might work at for years, worth? By hiring an interview coach, you invest in yourself, and you’re investing in your future. Isn’t it better to spend hours preparing for an interview, interviewing for a few positions that truly interest you, and receiving offers; Rather than, wasting interview after interview with no offers, and struggling to find your next venture?
