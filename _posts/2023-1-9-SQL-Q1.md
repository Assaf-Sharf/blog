## SQL Practice Problems (1)

Today, I solved various practice problems for SQL on school.programmers.co.kr, which is a korean website that provides sample coding problems. 
I will be going over some of the questions that I did that I needed some time to research in order to solve.

### The amount of customers who bought the product by year, month, gender

```
user_info
+-------------------------------------+
|Column name |   Type     |  Nullable |
+-------------------------------------+
|USER_ID     | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
|GENDER	     | TINYINT(1) |   TRUE    |
|AGE	     | INTEGER    |   TRUE    |
|JOINED	     | DATE       |   FALSE   |
+-------------------------------------+
Gender column is empty or either 0 or 1, which 0 is male, and 1 is female. 

online_sale
+--------------------------------------+
|Column name    |  Type    |  Nullable |
+--------------------------------------+
|ONLINE_SALE_ID |  INTEGER |   FALSE   |
|USER_ID        |  INTEGER |   FALSE   |
|PRODUCT_ID     |  INTEGER |   TRUE    |
|SALES_AMOUNT   |  INTEGER |   TRUE    |
|SALES_DATE     |  DATE    |   FALSE   |
+--------------------------------------+
There is only one sales data for same combination of date, user id, and product id.

From user_info table and online_sale table, find the amount of customers
who bought the product grouped by year, month, and gender.
Result needs to be in ascending order of year, month, and gender sequentially.
If there is no data for gender, exclude the data.
```
My first attempt:
```sql
SELECT YEAR(os.sales_date) AS year, MONTH(os.sales_date) AS month, gender, COUNT(os.user_id) AS USERS
FROM user_info AS ui
    INNER JOIN online_sale AS os ON ui.user_id = os.user_id
GROUP BY year, month, gender
HAVING gender IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY year, month, gender
```
In here, I inner joined the two tables through user_id key and grouped by year, month, and gender. 
From there, I filtered out the null data in gender column by HAVING statement. 
Then I ordered the data by year, month, and gender. When I ran the code, it seemed right, but the code was incorrect.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT YEAR(os.sales_date) AS year, MONTH(os.sales_date) AS month, gender, COUNT(DISTINCT os.user_id) AS USERS
FROM user_info AS ui
    INNER JOIN online_sale AS os ON ui.user_id = os.user_id
GROUP BY year, month, gender
HAVING gender IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY year, month, gender
```
The solution was hidden in DISTINCT, which is used to exclude the overlapping data. 
If I do not use the DISTINCT, I would count the amount of total users who bought the product including users who bought the product twice, 
and that is not what the problem wanted.

### Finding out the adopted time (2)

```
animal_outs
+------------------------------------------+
|  Column name      |  Type    |  Nullable |
+------------------------------------------+
|  ANIMAL_ID        | INTEGER  |   FALSE   |
|  ANIMAL_TYPE      | INTEGER  |   FALSE   |
|  DATETIME         | DATETIME |   TRUE    |
|  NAME             | INTEGER  |   TRUE    |
|  SEX_UPON_OUTCOME | DATE     |   FALSE   |
+------------------------------------------+

The animal shelter is trying to find out what time of hour was the adoption happened the most in 24 hours from 0 to 23.
Query the amount of adoption that happened in each hours. Order the data by hour, and if none happened, the data needs to say 0.
```

My first attempt:
```sql
SELECT HOUR(datetime) AS HOUR, COUNT(*) AS COUNT
FROM animal_outs
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour
```
This solution only shows the hour and the amount of adoption that happened at that time. 
So it excludes the hours and counts that adoption did not happen.
To solve this problem, I had to research on what function I needed to use to run the code that acts like a while statement in Python. 
With some research, this is the answer I got.

Solution:
```sql
SET @i = -1;
SELECT (@i := @i + 1) AS hour
     , (SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM animal_outs
        WHERE HOUR(datetime) = @i) AS count
FROM animal_outs
WHERE @i < 23
```

I Assigned a variable @i with ```SET```. '@' is necessary to use as a variable. 
When assigning a variable, both '=' and ':=' can be used, but in other cases, only ':=' is used.
By setting @i as -1 that goes up by 1 and limiting the variable to below 23, all the variables of 0 to 23 are made. 
And I made a sub-query of to count the amount of adoptions corresponding to the @i value (hour adopted) which is 0 to 23. 
I thought about using case statements too, but it would be too inefficient to make 23 cases.

Overall, I think some of the problems like the ones above that I solved today were challenging and they needed some effort to solve. 
However, I think the process of solving the solution and researching how to solve the question was entertaining.
