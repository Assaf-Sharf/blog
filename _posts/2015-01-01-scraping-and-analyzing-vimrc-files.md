So there I was, learning vim, smashing my head against the learning curve again. For a distraction I thought it would be more fun to write a casper.js scraper to look at other people's .vimrc files to see how they set theirs up.

The process and files are detailed over on the actual experiment page.

If I were to do it over again, I definitely would normalize some settings that are aliases for each other, but being a novice slowed me down on that front.
