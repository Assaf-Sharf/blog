<p><p>Microsoft has announced further support for Amazon's personal assistant platform, with Skype integration being officially announced.</p>
<p>Following continued collaboration between Amazon and Microsoft by integrating Alexa and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/cortana/'><img alt='Small Cortana icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/cortana_118198.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Cortana</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/amazon-echo/'><img alt='Small Amazon Echo (Alexa Voice Service) icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/amazon-echo_86399.webp?format=png&width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Amazon Echo (Alexa Voice Service)</a> devices will now be able to make Skype audio and video calls.</p>
<p>Skype integration with Alexa is simple, according to the official Skype blog announcement post:<br />
&quot;For example, simply say, 'Alexa, call Jimmy on Skype,' or if Jimmy is calling you on Skype, say, 'Alexa, answer.'&quot;</p>
<p>This Skype implementation comes shortly after support for Alexa was added to Microsoft's Xbox One series of devices. Skype for Alexa is slated to launch &quot;later this year.&quot;</p>
