<p><p>Another massive controversy has befallen Facebook today, with 50 million users' accounts potentially being impacted by a data breach.</p>
<p>Guy Rosen, Facebook's Vice President of Product Management, <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/" rel="nofollow">posted a security update</a> on the company's newsroom. This update details that Facebook has reset access tokens for 90 million accounts, 50 million of which are known to have been impacted.</p>
<p>In an update to the newsroom post, Rosen also detailed that there are three separate flaws that hackers utilized in order to compromise this user data. The vulnerabilities are listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First: View As is a privacy feature that lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else. View As should be a view-only interface. However, for one type of composer (the box that lets you post content to Facebook) — specifically the version that enables people to wish their friends happy birthday — View As incorrectly provided the opportunity to post a video.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second: A new version of our video uploader (the interface that would be presented as a result of the first bug), introduced in July 2017, incorrectly generated an access token that had the permissions of the Facebook mobile app.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Third: When the video uploader appeared as part of View As, it generated the access token not for you as the viewer, but for the user that you were looking up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When used together, the three exploits above enabled hackers to generate access tokens and log in as other users. Rosen states that Facebook's development team has &quot;fixed the vulnerability.&quot;</p>
