<p><p>Starting with version 48, the Android version of the Opera web browser can now be set to block cookie prompts on websites automatically.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.opera.com/mobile/2018/11/opera-for-android-48/" rel="nofollow">As detailed by Stefan Stjernelund on Opera's official blog</a>, this functionality was developed in response to the dramatic increase in cookie and privacy prompt dialogue boxes on websites following the implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation back in May. These website prompts are being treated similarly to ads in <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/opera/'><img alt='Small Opera icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/opera_81297.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Opera</a>, with the ability to remove them (as well as the ability to accept them) being found in &quot;Settings &gt; Ad blocking&quot; in the app's built-in ad blocker settings.</p>
<p>Opera Software has yet to announce this automatic cookie blocking and accepting functionality for the browser's other platforms.</p>
