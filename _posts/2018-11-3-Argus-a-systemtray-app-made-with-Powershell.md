# Argus, my favorite dog!

Hi! 

This blogpost is about one of the projects i'm most proud of!

One part of my job is being part of the helpdesk. When called by a customer or colleage, i usually ask for their computername. Most users tend not to know the name by heart (com'on guys!) or have a hard time figuering out where to find it. With the deployment of Windows 10 this became even more prevelant. 

So one day i was reading r/Powershell over at Reddit and i found this post

A user linked to a script over at Microsoft's script gallery. I took a look and the screenshot kinda gave me the idea to build this for our users. This would make things SO much easier to explain to them. Now i wanted to create this but when opening the script, i found out that the GUI was in XAML-format. I had never used this before and had always skipped past it.

So after doing my research i concluded that the easiest way to edit this was to install Visual Studio Community edition, a free version of Visual Studio.

Because i have a background in webdev, it wasn't too crazy to figure out how to edit it and how everything seemed to be working with names and id's.
