<p>iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch users hoping to update to iOS 12 and jump into a FaceTime call with up to 31 other people will have to wait a little bit longer.</p><p>9to5Mac's Guilherme Rambo [shared news about the delay](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1029049364545777664) on Twitter. According to Apple's patch notes for the latest iOS 12 beta, "Group FaceTime has been removed from the initial release of iOS 12," with the company planning on officially launching the feature in a supplemental update to iOS 12 "later this fall."</p><p>For those that were excited to use group video calling because of Apple's end-to-end encrypted, privacy-focused framework, other end-to-end encrypted alternatives that support group video calling on https://alternativeto.net/software/ios/ include https://alternativeto.net/software/whatsapp/ (which [just launched](https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/8/whatsapp-four-person-group-video-calling-has-launched) 4-person encrypted video calls on July 30th) and https://alternativeto.net/software/wire/.</p>
