<p><p>Movie and television show streaming service Hulu just launched an updated redesign of its website on September 20th.</p>
<p>This redesign for the subscription based television show streaming service went live following the debut of <a href="https://youtu.be/b_jQ13jaQOQ" rel="nofollow">a new ad campaign at the Emmys</a>. This more thumbnail focused design is centered around the concept of minimizing the amount of clicks needed to start watching content. Simply hovering over the thumbnail of a film or show will show users the play button for that content.</p>
<p>The Watchlist feature has now moved into the My Stuff section, making it grouped with users' already liked and watched movies and TV shows.</p>
