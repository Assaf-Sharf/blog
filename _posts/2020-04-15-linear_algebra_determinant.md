# Scaling a Region
So far within our transformation, you might have noticed that
some transformations *stretch* the plane while others *squish* it.
It might be useful to know exactly how much things are being
*stretched* or *squished*.
More specifically to measure the factor of which a given area
or region increases or decreases.

## Simple Transformation
For example, let's take a look at the following matrix and draw it
out (see picture one).

    [ 3  0 ]
    [ 0  2 ]

If we focus our attention on the `1 x 1 ` square in the original matrix,
whose bottom sits on *i* and left side sits on *j*.
After the transformation occurs, the square transforms into a `3 x 2 `
rectangle.

Since it started with an __area__ of 1 and ended with an __area__ of 6,
we can say that after the transformation, the area was scaled by a
factor of 6.

## A Shear
Now let's take a look at a shear instead and draw it out
(see picture two).

    [ 1  1 ]
    [ 0  1 ]

The same `1 x 1` square gets slanted and turned into a parallelogram.
But the __area__ of the parallelogram is still 1, since the
base and height of the parallelogram as `1 x 1`.
Although this transformation *squishes* the plane, it leaves the
area the same, as least for that one square.

## Rule of Thumb
If you can tell how much the area of that `1 x 1` changes,
it can tell you any possible region of space changes, due to the
transformation.
Whatever happens to one square in the grid, has to happen to all the
square in the grid, no matter the size.
This is due to the earlier rule we have, __all grid lines must remain
parallel and evenly spaced__.

## Area of a Shaped Curve
If we have a shape that is not a grid square, it can be approximated by
grid squares pretty well.
Depending on the size of the grid squares we put inside the shaped
(see picture 3).

So if the area of all those tiny grid squares is being scaled,
the area of the entire shape will also be scaled by that same amount.

# The *Determinant*
The value which we use to describe the scaling of the `1 x 1` square,
is known as the *determinant* of that transformation.
We will go over how to numerically compute the *determinant* later on,
but understanding what it represents is far more important.

The *determinant* of a transformation would be 3 if that
transformation increases the area by a factor of three.

    det([ 0.0  2.0 ]) = 3
       ([-1.5  1.0 ])

The *determinant* of a transformation would be 1/2 if that
transformation squishes the area by of all squares by
a factor of 1/2.

    det([ 0.5  0.5 ]) = 0.5
       ([-0.5  0.5 ])

The *determinant* of a two-dimensional transformation is 0,
if it squishes all of space onto a line, or onto a single point.
Since then, the area of any region would become 0.

    det([ 4  2 ]) = 0
       ([ 2  1 ])

The realization of this is very important.
It means that checking to see if the *determinant* of a given matrix
is 0, will tell us whether or not the transformation
associated with that matrix *squishes* everything into a
smaller dimension.
Or in some extreme cases, is on a single point.

    det([ 0  0 ]) = 0
       ([ 0  0 ])

## Maybe I Didn't Tell You Everything...
It is possible of having a transformation with a *negative* *determinant*.
But what does a *negative* *determinant* even tell us?

    det([ 1  2 ]) = -2.0
       ([ 3  4 ])

This has to do with the idea of *orientation*.
There are transformation that seems to *flip* over the plane.
If we think about a piece of paper, they seem to flip the page over
onto the other side.
Any transformation that does this, is said to invert the
*orientation* of space.

Another way to think about it is with *i* and *j*.
Notice that in their starting position, *j* is to the left of *i*.
If after a transformation, *j* is on the right of *i*, the
*orientation* of space has been inverted (see picture 4).

Whenever this happens, whenever the *orientation* of space is
inverted, the *orientation* will be negative.
The absolute value of the *determinant* will still tell you the
factor by which areas have been scaled.

    det([ 2  1 ]) = -5.0
       ([-1 -3 ])

### Why Does Negative Mean Orientation-Flipping?
So the question arises, why would *orientation-flipping* be
naturally described by a negative *determinant*?
The closer *i* gets to *j* the more the *determinant* decreases.
Eventually as *i* and *j* "touch", the *determinant* is 0.
Now that *j* is to the right of *i* and they are moving apart,
doesn't it make sense to describe the value as a negative
(see picture 5)?

## *Determinants* in Three Dimensions
Like with Two-Dimensions, the *determinant* tells you how much a
transformation scales things.
But now instead of telling you the __area__ that is scaled,
it tells you how to scale the __volume__.

Just as in two-dimensions we follow the area of the `1 x 1` square
during a transformation.
In three-dimensions it's best to follow the __volume__ of the
`1 x 1 x 1` cube during a transformation.
The resulting *slanty* cube is called a "Parallelepiped"
(try saying that 5 times really fast).

    det([ 1.0  0.0  0.5 ]) = Volume of the
       ([ 0.5  1.0  0.0 ])   resulting
       ([ 1.0  0.0  1.0 ])   parallelepiped

As we said earlier, if we have a *determinant* of 0 it has one of
two meanings.
Either the three-dimensional plane has been *squished* down a
dimension.
Meaning that it is now on a flat plane (two-dimension),
a line (one-dimension), or in extreme cases, onto a single point.

Those of you who read
[the second post](/categories/math/linear_algebra/linear_combination_spans_and_basic_vectors)
will recognize that the columns of the matrix are *linearly dependent*.

    det([ 1.0  0.0  0.5 ]) = 0
       ([ 0.5  1.0  0.0 ])   
       ([ 1.0  0.0  1.0 ])   
           ^    ^    ^
         Columns must be
         linearly dependent

### Negative *Determinants* in Three-Dimensions
The easiest way to tell if the *determinant* is positive is to use
the right-hand rule
(Consider *a* to be *i*, *b* to be *j* and *a x b* to be *k*).
![right](/assets/images/right_hand_rule_right.png)

If after the transformation you can still use the right-hand rule,
then *orientation* has not changed, and the *determinant* is still positive.
Otherwise, if it makes more sense to use your left hand to describe
the matrix, *orientation* has been flipped, and the *determinant* is
negative.

## Computing the *Determinant*
The formula for two-dimensions is:

    det([ a  b ]) = ad - bc
       ([ c  d ])

Let's take a look at how this formula came to be.
If we make `b, c = 0`,
`a` tells you how much *i* is stretched in the *x* direction and
`d` tells you how much *j* is stretched in the *y* direction
(see picture six).

    det([ a  0 ]) = ad - 0 * 0
       ([ 0  d ])

This makes sense, since `a * d `gives us the area of the rectangle
that our `1 x 1` unit square turns into.
This is evident if we look at our earlier example
(see picture one).

    [ 3  0 ]
    [ 0  2 ]

Even if one of `b` or `c` is 0, we get a parallelogram,
with a base of `a` and a height of `d` (see picture 7).

    det([ a  b ]) = ad - b * 0
       ([ 0  d ])

If both `b` and `c` are non-zero, then the `b * c` term,
tells us how much the parallelogram is
*stretched* or *squished* in the diagonal direction
(see picture seven).

For those of you who want a more in-depth proof,
take a look at this.

This is also true for finding the *determinant* in three-dimension.

    det([ a  b  c ]) =
       ([ d  e  r ])
       ([ g  h  i ])
                        a det([ e  f ])
                             ([ h  i ])

                      - b det([ d  f ])
                             ([ g  i ])

                      + c det([ d  e ])
                             ([ g  h ])

### Key Concept
I believe that computing the *determinant*
is not necessarily important to understand the essence of linear
algebra.
While being able to understand what the *determinant* represents,
falls within that essence.

Here's a fun activity, try to rationalize the following
in one sentence.
It would take forever to do this using computation,
but if you understand the key concept of the *determinant*,
it's fairly straight forward.

`det(M1 * M2) = det(M1) * det(M2)`
