<p><p>Apple has disabled the ability to make Group FaceTime calls following the discovery of a major flaw that allows users to listen to audio broadcasted from a recipient's device before they answered the call.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/" rel="nofollow">Apple system status page</a> shows that Apple disabled Group FaceTime shortly after the bug was discovered and publicized on Monday evening. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/" rel="nofollow">Originally reported and demonstrated by 9to5Mac</a>, the potential for damage before Apple forced the feature offline was massive. As 9to5Mac put it, &quot;if your phone is ringing with an incoming FaceTime request, the person on the other end could be listening in.&quot;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facetime-bug-iphone" rel="nofollow">a statement to BuzzFeed News</a>, Apple announced that it has generated a fix to the exploit and that it will be deployed to <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_138506.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a> users &quot;later this week.&quot; Until said software update is distributed, there is no longer any risk of this exploit being utlized because of Group FaceTime being disabled, so your FaceTime calls are safe.</p>
<p>For users that need group video conversations on their iOS devices in the meantime, good alternatives include <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/whatsapp/'><img alt='Small WhatsApp Messenger icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/whatsapp_58669.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />WhatsApp Messenger</a> and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-hangouts/'><img alt='Small Hangouts icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-hangouts_83729.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Hangouts</a>, with WhatsApp supporting up to four simultaneous video call participants and Google Hangouts supporting up to 25 participants.</p>
