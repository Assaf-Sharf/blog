<p><p>Following Apple's relatively buggy release of iOS 11, the company has seemingly taken feedback and the experience to heart. iOS 12 has been nearly bug free, and that has paid off for Apple in terms of users updating.</p>
<p>As Apple describes on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/" rel="nofollow">its recently updated Apple Developer Support page for the App Store</a>, iOS 12's adoption rate has been quite successful since <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/9/apple-releasing-ios-macos-tvos-and-watchos-updates-this-month" rel="nofollow">its launch last month</a>. As of October 10th, 50% of all iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch models compatible with <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_88776.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a> 12 that have connected to the <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/app-store/'><img alt='Small Apple App Store icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/app-store_112799.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Apple App Store</a> have downloaded and installed it.</p>
<p>This rapid kind of update adoption in the span of a month is quite impressive, especially when framed against its main competitor in the smart device OS space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/12/half-of-all-devices-now-run-ios-12/" rel="nofollow">According to Sarah Perez at TechCrunch</a>, the latest versions of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a>, 8.0 and 8.1 Oreo, have been installed on only 19.2% of compatible Android devices. Of course, this is likely due to Google only directly pushing the update to its own Android One, Nexus, and Pixel devices. Devices manufactured by third parties have their updates primarily managed by the manufacturers and cell phone carriers.</p>
