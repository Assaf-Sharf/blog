# What is an Interview Coach

If you want to improve your chances at landing your dream job, you’re going to greatly benefit from [interview prep](/interview_prep/what_is_interview_prep_and_why_you_need_it). But to do interview prep sufficiently, you're going to need an interview coach. What is an interview coach, what do they do, who’s qualified, how do you find the right one?

## Interview Coaches  Qualifications
An interview coach is someone who has in-depth experience as an interviewer. They’re someone who understands what it is that interviewers are looking for in candidates. They are able to understand the qualities that the right candidate for the roles you are applying for possesses and aid you in displaying those qualities.

## Interview Coaches Job
They are going to be able to dissect your interviews, whether they be mock interviews, or recordings of interviews you’ve had with potential employers, and give you __honest__ feedback. They need to be able to build a profile on you, based on patterns and mistakes that you are making with potential employers. They can then device gameplans for you to mitigate those mistakes. They need to also figure out knowledge gaps that you may have, and things you need to learn to be a better fit for the job.

They must also be able to find your strengths and give you ways to display those strengths in your interviews. Overall, an interview coach is someone who can groom you into the perfect candidate regardless of the interviewer.

## What an Interview Coach Shouldn’t Be

* One size fits all
* Does mock interviews but doesn't provide in-depth feedback

When searching for the right interview coach, you want to make sure you avoid specific interview coaches. You want to avoid a “one size fits all” coach, these are coaches who have generic plans that they distribute to the masses. They are not tailored to your needs. You need a custom fit, someone who takes the time to understand you and spends time analyzing your interviews and needs.

Avoid programs where you spend an hour interviewing with someone, then they spend 10 minutes afterward telling you what went wrong, and you no longer hear from them. You want someone who is going to build a running profile on you. This profile will grow, change, and evolve, as you do.

# Hiring Me As Your Interview Coach
I am an engineer with 4+ years of experience as a System Admin, an SRE, and most recently, a DevOps Engineer at Microsoft. At Microsoft, I interviewed several dozen candidates for various positions and roles.

## My Qualifications and Ideologies

As someone who has spent countless hours devising interview questions, conducting interviews, and debriefing with a larger team, I am aware of the qualities that interviewers are looking for in the right candidate. I noticed many common errors from candidates who did not receive an offer, and I also noticed similar strengths in candidates who did receive job offers.

The thing is, most of the winning qualities that interviewers are looking for are possessed by the candidates who get rejected, unfortunately, they just don’t know how to display these qualities. I am also aware of the qualities that raise red flags for interviewers. This is what inspired me to provide this tailored service. I wanted to help candidates express the winning qualities that interviewers are looking for, and avoid displaying red flags so that can land their dream jobs.

## My Ideologies On Preparing For an Interview
I believe that different people, in different stages of their careers and for different roles are going to require different types of interviewing coaches. A senior Java developer will need a different interview coach from a DevOps Engineer. Sure, there will be an overlap on various technologies, tools, and overall engineering best practices, but you want to find the coach that fits most closely to your needs.  A quarterback and offensive lineman both need a strength and conditioning coach, but they’re going to need a custom, tailored workout routine for their individual role so that they can individually perform to the best of their abilities.

Interviewing is like taking a driving test. The tester doesn’t care whether or not you are able to drive a car, they don't care if you can turn, they want to see you perform a 3-point turn, they want to see you check your mirrors. They ultimately have a few boxes that they need to check, and red flags they don't want to raise. It’s the job of your interview coach to present those boxes and red flags to you, so that you may understand the test, and learn to show the driving instructor only what they want to see.

# My Business Ideologies
In actuality, I might not be the right interview coach for you, and if that's the case, I will tell you. Unlike various big programs, I am not looking to expand my business and lure in as many clients as possible to maximize my profits. I would like to work with a few clients at a time, so that I may give each client the attention they need to be successful in their job search.

My goal is for clients to stop requiring my [services](/interview_prep/services_provided) as quickly as possible. I don’t want to monetize off of you. In these troubling times, where many people have lost their jobs, I want to do whatever I can to help you land the right job.
