# What is an Interview Coach

If you want to improve your chances of landing your dream job, you’re going to greatly benefit from [interview prep](/interview_prep/what_is_interview_prep_and_why_you_need_it). For effective interview prep, you’re going to need an experienced interview coach. At this point, you may be wondering, what is an interview coach, what do they do, who is qualified, and how do I find the right one?

## Interview Coaches' Qualifications

A good interview coach is someone who has in-depth experience as an interviewer. They’re someone who understands what interviewers are looking for in candidates. They know what qualities successful candidates have, and they can aid you in displaying those qualities.

## The Job of an Interview Coach.

Good interview coaches  are going to be able to dissect your interviews, whether they be mock interviews  or recordings of interviews you’ve had with potential employers, and give you **honest** feedback. An interview coach needs to do the following:

-   Build a profile on you, based on patterns and mistakes that you are making with potential employers.

    -   Your interview coaches can then design a gameplan for you to mitigate those mistakes.

-   Figure out what knowledge gaps you may have and what you need to learn to be a better fit for your dream job.

-   Find your strengths and provide you with ways to display those strengths in your interviews.


Overall, an interview coach is someone who can groom you into the perfect candidate regardless of the interviewer.

## What an Interview Coach Shouldn’t Be

-   Someone with a one-size-fits-all approach.

-   Does mock interviews but doesn't provide in-depth feedback


When searching for the right interview coach, you want to  avoid specific interview coaches. You want to avoid a “one-size-fits-all” coach; these are coaches who have generic plans that they distribute to everyone. These coaches are not tailored to your needs. You need a coach who will customize a plan just for you. Someone who takes the time to understand you and your needs.

Avoid programs where you spend an hour interviewing with a mock interview, then they simply spend 10 minutes afterward telling you what went wrong, and you never hear from them again. You want someone who is going to build a running profile on you. This profile will grow, change, and evolve, as you do.

# Hiring Me As Your Interview Coach

I am an engineer with 4+ years of experience as a System Admin, an SRE, and most recently, a DevOps Engineer at Microsoft. At Microsoft, I interviewed dozens of candidates for various positions and roles.

## My Qualifications and Ideologies

As someone who has spent countless hours devising interview questions, conducting interviews, and debriefing with a larger team, I am aware of the qualities that interviewers are looking for in the right candidate. I noticed many common errors from candidates who did not receive an offer, and I also noticed common strengths in candidates who did receive job offers.

The thing is, most of the candidates who are rejected possess winning qualities, but, unfortunately, they do not know how to demonstrate those qualities in an interview. In addition, I aware of the qualities that raise red flags for interviewers. This is what inspired me to provide a service tailored to your needs. I wanted to help candidates express the winning qualities that interviewers are looking for and avoid displaying red flags so that can land their dream jobs.

## My Ideologies On Preparing For an Interview

I believe that different people, in different stages of their careers and for different roles, are going to require different types of interviewing coaches. For example, a senior Java developer will need a different interview coach from a DevOps Engineer. Sure, there will be an overlap in various technologies, tools, and overall engineering best practices, but you want to find the coach that fits most closely to your needs. A quarterback and offensive lineman both need a strength and conditioning coach, but they’re going to need a custom, tailored workout routine for their individual role so that they can  perform to the best of their abilities.

Interviewing is like taking a driving test. The tester doesn’t care whether or not you are able to drive a car, they don't care if you can turn, but they want to see you perform a 3-point turn, they want to see you check your mirrors. They ultimately have a few boxes that they need to check, and red flags they don't want you to raise. It’s the job of your interview coach to present those boxes and red flags to you, so that you may understand the test and learn to show the driving instructor only what they want to see.
