<p><p>Users that have taken advantage of Skype's extended legacy version support will need to either update or find an alternative communications application come this November.</p>
<p>The Skype development team announced that support for version 7 of Skype will end on November 1st for its desktop variant, and on November 15th for its mobile variant.</p>
<p>This November discontinuation of Skype older than version 8 is delayed from <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/7/skype-releases-version-8-will-introduce-end-to-end-encryption-and-built-in-call-recording" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's original intent</a> to discontinue support for older Skype versions on September 1st.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade-to-the-latest-version-of-skype-for-desktop/" rel="nofollow">updated blog post</a> also states that, despite support being discontinued on November 1st and 15th, &quot;...you may be able to use older versions for a little while....&quot; Of course, the development team recommends that users &quot;update today to avoid any interruption.&quot;</p>
