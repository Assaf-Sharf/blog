Here I conduct basic time series forecasting using SARIMA models. I download historical stock data from Yahoo! Finance, perform some basic statistical tests (standard deviation, Kurtosis), grid search SARIMA hyperparameters and build and evaluate the resulting models. The full notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/mkm29/DataScience/blob/master/SARIMA%20for%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting.ipynb).
