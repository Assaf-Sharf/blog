## Learning more basics and intermediate skills of SQL
Today, I learned more basics and some advanced skills in SQL and did some practice problems from HackerRank and Leetcode.
I will list couple of problems that I did here.

### My code for today
1) **Rising Temperature** from Leetcode:

Write an SQL query to find all dates' ```Id``` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.
```
Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```
My answer:
```sql
SELECT id
FROM Weather AS today
    INNER JOIN Weather AS yesterday ON DATE_ADD(yesterday.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = today.recordDate
WHERE today.temperature > yesterday.temperature
```
I self joined the Weather table so that I can compare the temperature of all dates to its previous dates (yesterday) by
```sql
 FROM Weather AS today
    INNER JOIN Weather AS yesterday ON DATE_ADD(yesterday.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = today.recordDate
```
this code. And then I gave a condition to query if the temperature was higher than the previous day through
```sql
WHERE today.temperature > yesterday.temperature
```
this code.

I struggled to find out how to self join the table, but knowing that I had to use ```DATE_ADD()``` helped a lot.


2) **Symmetric Pairs** from HackerRank:
```
You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
+------------+-------------+
|   Column   |    Type     |
+------------+-------------+
|      X     |   Integer   |
|      Y     |   Integer   |
+------------+-------------+
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Sample Input:
+------------+-------------+
|      X     |      Y      |
+------------+-------------+
|     20     |     20      |
|     20     |     20      |
|     20     |     21      |
|     23     |     22      |
|     22     |     23      |
|     21     |     20      |
+------------+-------------+

Sample Output:

+---------+
| 20  20  |
| 20  21  |
| 22  23  |
+---------+
```
My answer:
```sql
SELECT X, Y
FROM Functions
WHERE X = Y
GROUP BY X, Y
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2

UNION

SELECT first.x, first.y
FROM Functions AS first
     INNER JOIN Functions AS second ON first.x = second.y AND second.x = first.y
WHERE first.x < first.y
ORDER BY x
```
I divided the answers into two parts: Where x = y, and where x1 = y2 and x2 = y1.
From my answer, the above part is the first part where I query the data where x = y.
Since the column where the same integer of x = y had to be in the data twice, 
I grouped x and y and counted the amount of times of occasions where x = y for each integer that was in the data.

And then I worked on the second part where x1 = y2 and x2 = y1.
Here, I self joined the Functions table where x1 = y2 and x2 = y1, and I made a condition to query only if x1 < y1.
I joined the two parts together by ```UNION``` function, and I ordered the data by the ascending order of the value of x.

It took a lot of time for me to understand the second question, and I really need a lot more practice to get more hang of those functions.
However, it feels like I understood the basic skills and formats that I need to know in SQL.
