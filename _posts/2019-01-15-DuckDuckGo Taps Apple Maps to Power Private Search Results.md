<img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/01/Hero-resized-1.png" alt="DuckDuckGo Taps Apple Maps to Power Private Search Results"><p>We're excited to announce that map and address-related searches on DuckDuckGo for mobile and desktop are now powered by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/maps/mapkitjs/">Apple's MapKit JS framework</a>, giving you a valuable combination of mapping and privacy. As one of the first global companies using Apple MapKit JS, we can now offer users improved address searches, additional visual features, enhanced satellite imagery, and continually updated maps already in use on billions of Apple devices worldwide.</p><p>With this updated integration, Apple Maps are now available both embedded within our private search results for relevant queries, as well as available from the &quot;Maps&quot; tab on any search result page. Let's see it in action…</p>

<li>With the example query <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pizza+in+Cupertino&amp;ia=places"><em>pizza in Cupertino</em></a>, the map appears as a module within the search results.</li>

<p>At DuckDuckGo, we believe getting the privacy you deserve online should be as simple as closing the blinds. Naturally, our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">strict privacy policy</a> of not collecting or sharing any personal information extends to this integration. We do not send any personally identifiable information such as IP address to Apple or other third parties. For local searches, where your approximate location information is sent by your browser to us, we discard it immediately after use. You are still anonymous when you perform map and address-related searches on DuckDuckGo. You can read more about our <a href="https://duck.co/help/privacy/anonymous-localized-results">anonymous localized results here</a>.</p>
<p>We’re excited to work closely with Apple to set a new standard of trust online, and we hope you'll enjoy this update. We also welcome your feedback, which can be sent via the &quot;Send feedback&quot; button at the bottom of search results.</p>
