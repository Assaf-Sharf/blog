## SQL Practice Problems (6)

Today, I practiced User-Defined Function in SQL. 
I solved a problem for SQL on LeetCode with various implications of User-Defined Function.

### Nth Highest Salary

This problem is from LeetCode.

```
Employee
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.
The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| null                   |
+------------------------+
```

Solution 1:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      SELECT CASE 
                WHEN COUNT(ref.salary) < N THEN NULL
                ELSE MIN(ref.salary)
             END
      FROM (
            SELECT DISTINCT salary
            FROM Employee
            ORDER BY salary DESC
            LIMIT N
            ) ref 
  );
END
```
I counted N as dense rank. With variable N being 'n'th maximum number, I made a subquery to get the salary from the highest to nth highest.
Then I made a condition to give null as an output if the number of the counted amount of salary is lower than N.

Solution 2:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      SELECT IF (COUNT(ref.salary) < N, NULL, MIN(ref.salary))
      FROM (
            SELECT DISTINCT salary
            FROM Employee
            ORDER BY salary DESC
            LIMIT N
            ) ref 
  );
END
```

In this solution, I gave a little change from the CASE sentence to IF sentence.

Solution 3:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  SET N = N - 1;
  RETURN (
      SELECT DISTINCT salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY salary DESC
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET N
  );
END
```

In this solution, I did not use subquery, but instead set the N to N - 1 and made the query to only print out the Nth maximum number 
using LIMIT 1 OFFSET N.

It was a good practice to use the user defined function, but I think I need some more time to get used to the application.
