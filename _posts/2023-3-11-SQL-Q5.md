## SQL Practice Problems (4)

I wasn't able to practice SQL these days because of the semester, but I started to practice again for the Spring break. 
Today, I practiced three problems to develop skills of using window function.

The format of window function is simple:

```FUNCTION(column) OVER (PARTITION BY x ORDER BY y)```

In the above format, function can be something like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LEAD(), LAG(), and more. 
PARTITION BY divides values depending on the column. ORDER BY literally orders value depending on the column.

### Department Highest Salary
This problem is from LeetCode. I wrote a solution not using the window function in SQL Practice Problems (4), 
but this time I'm solving it using the window function:
```
Employee
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+

Department
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+

Write an SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.
```
Solution not using window function:
```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department
     , e.name AS Employee
     , e.salary AS Salary
FROM employee AS e
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT departmentid, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
        FROM employee
        GROUP BY departmentid
    ) AS dh ON e.departmentid = dh.departmentid
    INNER JOIN department AS d ON e.departmentid = d.id
WHERE e.salary = dh.max_salary
```

Solution using window function:
```sql
SELECT Department
     , Employee
     , Salary
FROM (
        SELECT e.name AS Employee
            , e.salary AS Salary
            , d.name AS Department
            , MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId) maxSalary
        FROM employee AS e
            INNER JOIN department AS d ON e.departmentId = d.id
     ) ref
WHERE salary = ref.maxSalary
```

Notice the general format of putting in the subquery at FROM is similar, 
but I added a column of a max salary of a corresponding department using window function.

### Consecutive Numbers
This problem is also from LeetCode. I will compare solutions with and without using the window function:
```
Logs
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column.

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
Return the result table in any order.
```

Solution without using window funciton:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM logs AS l1
    INNER JOIN logs AS l2 ON l1.id + 1= l2.id
    INNER JOIN logs AS l3 ON l1.id + 2= l3.id
WHERE l1.num = l2.num
AND l1.num = l3.num
```

Solution using window function:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
     SELECT Num
          , LEAD(Num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next
          , LEAD(Num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next2
     FROM logs
     ) sub
WHERE Num = next
AND next = next2
```

In here, I self-joined the table three times to find out what rows have the same value at least 3 times consecutively.
But in the solution using window function, I used subquery at FROM to align 3 adjacent values in the same row to compare them.

Personally, I think self-joining was easier in this type of problems.

### Department Top Three Salaries

This problem is also from LeetCode:
```
Employee
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.

Department
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.
Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees
```

Solution:
```sql
SELECT Department
     , Employee
     , Salary
FROM (
    SELECT d.name AS Department
        , e.name AS Employee
        , e.salary AS Salary
        , DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentid ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dr
    FROM employee AS e
        INNER JOIN department AS d ON e.departmentId = d.id
    ) ref
WHERE ref.dr <= 3
```

Notice the problem asks for top three unique salaries for a certain department, but in the example, there are 4 rows with the same department. 
This would mean that the rank would go like 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, meaning it is a dense rank.

So I used ```DENSE_RANK()``` to rank all the salaries in the subquery, and I used WHERE to only show those who are equal to or higher than third place.

Overall, using the window function was fairly easy, but the real implication to various situations is a bit difficult 
because I need to know in what part I should use the window function.
