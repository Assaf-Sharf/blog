<p><p>Video game developer and publisher Blizzard Entertainment has announced that it is both discontinuing the esports scene and scaling back development for Heroes of the Storm, its multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game.</p>
<p>The company announced the news <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/22833558/heroes-of-the-storm-news" rel="nofollow">on its official website</a> that it is making these drastic changes to the development and competitive pipelines of Heroes of the Storm to &quot;take some of our talented developers and bring their skills to other projects,&quot; and to not host their competitive circuit &quot;in a way that would not meet the standards that players and fans have come to expect.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite scaling back in development and discontinuing its esports support, Blizzard also stated that it will &quot;actively support&quot; <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/heroes-of-the-storm/'><img alt='Small Heroes of the Storm icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/heroes-of-the-storm_64877.jpg?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Heroes of the Storm</a> with new playable characters and events (with the added caveat that &quot;the cadence will change&quot;).</p>
<p>For some users, this may leave them looking for a MOBA game that is still regularly updated and has an esports scene supported by its developer. Both <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/league-of-legends/'><img alt='Small League of Legends icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/league-of-legends_74627.jpg?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />League of Legends</a> and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/dota-2/'><img alt='Small Dota 2 icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/dota-2_20047.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Dota 2</a> are still being actively developed and have esports scenes actively cultivated by their developers.</p>
