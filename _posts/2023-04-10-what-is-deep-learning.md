An artificial neural network based on multilayer process layer.

##**What is machine learning?**

![img](/images/2023-04-10-what-is-deep-learning/img.png)

It is a technology that converts objects or data into numbers and finds patterns in those numbers.

The computer performs the task through code or mathematics.

Machine learning is at the bottom of artificial intelligence and deep learning is at the bottom.



##**What is the difference between traditional programing and machine learning and deep learning programming?**

In traditional programming, output is generated through input codes.

But, ml/dl algorithms inform the input datas and inform the ideal results.



##**Why we use machine learning, deep learning?**

If you were asked to program a code for self-driving car, could you design all those rules?

As long as it can be translated into numbers and patterns, we can machine-learn about everything in the universe.



##**Bad case for applying deep learning.**

- If clear explanation is required

Patterns learned by deep learning models are generally not appropriate because they are not interpretable by humans.



- If simple rule-based system enables you to achieve your goals

There is no need for ML/DL.



- When an error should not occur

The results of deep learning are not always predictable.

It can be rather bad when it is necessary to repeat the results.



##**Machine learning vs deep learning**

Traditional machine learning typically maximizes performance on structured data.

Google or Excel spreadsheet. Deep learning maximizes performance in unstructured data such as natural language and text shapes.



##**Machine learning related algorithms**

Random forest

naive bayes

nearest neighbor

support vector machine

and so on

Since the advent of deep learning, these algorithms are usually called shallow algorithms.



##**Deep learning related algorithms**

neural network

Fully Connected Neural Network

Spiral Neural Network

Regression Neural Networks

transformer architecture



These algorithms have been the basis of other deep learning algorithms for decades.



However, these algorithms above are sometimes used depending on how you define the problem regardless of classifications.



##**What is a neural network?**

It refers to the circuit or connection of neurons, and in the modern sense, it refers to an artificial node network consisting of artificial neurons and nodes.

Unstructured data is translated into numbers (nemeographic encoding) (tensor)

When these numerized data is put into the neural network, it begins to learn patterns, characteristics, and weights.

The neural network to process the data is selected differently depending on the purpose.

after this, representation values are created as output of tensor.

Labeling work is done based on this representation values.



##**Atonomy of neural network**

The first layer of the neural network is called the input layer.

There are a hidden layers in the middle, finds patterns in the data,

The output layer, Returns the representative value or predicted probability value learned in the output layer.

embedding, weights, feature, representation, feature, vectors. All are used in a similar sense.



##**Types of Learning**

There are supervised learning. semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning, etc.



Suppose that you make them learn to identify the type of food, such as ramen.



In supervised learning, images of all labeled foods are learned.



In semi-supervised learning, there is a amount of data equivalent to supervised learning, but the mapping of labels is less. In other words, the unlabeled images get labeled.



Unsupervised learning has only data and no labels.

By inputting data into neural networks- machine learning, deep learning , any data outputs results.



Transfer learning can be said to be the flower of deep learning, and it is to reapply patterns output from other learning to other problems.



##**What is deep learning used for?**

Numerical Encoding -> Learning and Labeling with Model



##**Use cases of deep learning**

recommendation system in Youtube, Google Translator, voice recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, etc

YouTube recommend videos based on User's Browsing history

Google translator learns the patterns of sentences through deep learning and translates them into the target language.



The voice recognition system translate sound waves into languages.



The anti-spam system analyzes the contents of e-mails and block spam.



Google Translation System and Voice recognition can be, respectively, seen as translate word sequences into different word sequences and speech sequence into another word sequence.



Computer vision or natural language processing uses classification and regression.

After performing multiple classifications, the regression occurs

This regression is known to be more suitable for numerical prediction.
