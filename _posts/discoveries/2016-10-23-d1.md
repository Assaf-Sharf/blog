> We must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the 
individual conform to the goal. 

At only 22 years old, [Hunter S. Thompson's extraordinary letter on finding your purpose](http://tranquilmonkey.com/hunter-s-thompsons-extraordinary-letter-on-finding-your-purpose) 
provides sound advice.

[Trey Veazey](https://www.treyveazey.com) has written a compelling request 
for help. Trey is a librarian from [Glen Oaks Park Elementary](https://www.donorschoose.org/school/glen-oaks-park-elementary-school/16821/?teachers=true) 
in Baton Rouge, whose library lost everything in the recent floods (Aug 2016). 
As someone who has loved books since I was old enough to hold them in my toddler 
sized hands, his plight resonates with me. Read his account and request at 
[A cry for help, or 1,600ish words on books, life, & honey buns](http://www.treyveazey.com/a-cry-for-help-or-1600ish-words-on-books-life-honey-buns/). 

If you want to help, donate via various methods Trey describes in the previous 
post and this one: [Brass tacks, or specifics regarding where, when, how, etc.](http://www.treyveazey.com/brass-tacks-or-specifics-regarding-where-when-how-etc/). 
My personal preference is [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/treyveazey) 
where donations are matched dollar-for-dollar when using the promotion code _**LIFTOFF**_.

A well written, transparent, and heartfelt story about a life lesson learned

Using regex statements can be painful, like a [_insert bad metaphor here_]. 
[Simple Regex Language](https://simple-regex.com) (SRL) is trying to help out.

[Stranger Things](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281) on Netflix is one 
of the best series I've ever watched. We binge-watched the last six episodes 
in a single night. It was _even_ a school/work night.

Reviewing pull requests (PRs) is difficult and tedious, so make it easier on 
your peers. Use small, frequent PRs versus large (& usually unwieldy), 
infrequent PRs in your software development (and documentation efforts). Write 
useful, detailed descriptions, saving the reviewer time understanding the scope 
and changes. In a nutshell, treat the code reviewer like your customer.

[Steve Sasman](https://medium.com/@SteveSasman) describes driving his 
[Tesla Model S](https://www.tesla.com/models) across country, Uber'ing in it, 
letting others sleep in it (for a small fee), and renting it to other drivers, 
all over 100,000 miles in 2 years. Fascinating to see how much it cost him, 
or didn't, in [How I Used & Abused My Tesla](https://medium.com/@SteveSasman/how-i-used-abused-my-tesla-what-a-tesla-looks-like-after-100-000-miles-a-48-state-road-trip-6b6ae66b3c10#.5it5ij5s7).
