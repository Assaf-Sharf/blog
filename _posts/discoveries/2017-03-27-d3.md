> We know what we know about Cahokia because Americans built a highway through 
  it. The law that created the interstate highway system in the 1960s 
  [included funding](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/01/cahokia/hodges-text) 
  to investigate archaeological sites that would be damaged, which meant scholars 
  had funding and a mandate to study Cahokia.

A thought provoking piece on colonialism and the ancient civilizations in 
North America. Discovered in the St. Louis area, 
[Cahokia, a city inhabited in 1250 by some ten to twenty thousand Native Americans.](https://priceonomics.com/why-do-tourists-visit-ancient-ruins-everywhere/)

Quickly send your own photos as snail-mail postcards via text with 
[Postacard](https://www.postacard.io/). Cool technology and concept. Is it a 
viable business idea given we can text the pictures directly for free?

Are you willing to be misunderstood, potentially for years or decades, in order

[Nir Eyal](https://NirAndFar.com) discusses how to improve your focus by 
removing distractions in the video: [Un-Hooked: Increasing Focus in the Age of Distraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j2Wg3kwZIk) [17:20]. 

1.  **Kill unwanted notifications.** This is a big one. I have my phone 
    configured so that only text messages and phone calls trigger an audible 
    ring/vibration. Likewise, I disable the popup notifications on my computer 
    for Outlook, Slack and other messaging apps. 
2.  **Don't use digital gadgets in meetingsâ€¦you checkout and aren't 
    getting/giving any value.** This is why I stopped taking my laptop to 
    meetings several years ago, opting instead for an old-school Moleskine 
    notebook for my notes. 
3.  **Boost creativity and productivity by sheltering yourself (or employees) 
    from distractions with timeframes specifically set aside to ignore 
    email/messaging.** I've tried to make this a habit over the years and, 
    admittedly, I'm still working on it. The times I do ignore Outlook/Slack/etc. 
    to focus on _real work_, I usually feel substantially more productive. 
4.  **Know your investment. Just because something is free to use, doesn't 
    mean there isn't a cost.** Our time and attention are the costs; arguably, 
    the most valuable things we possess. 
    1.  Make it more difficult to access by logging out between use, closing 
        the browser tab, and burying the icon app a few screens deep so you have 
        to scroll a few times to get to it.  
    2.  Use attention/retention tools (Forest, Pocket, and Freedom).

[Michael Wolfe](http://www.michaelrwolfe.com/) provides an honest (and quite 
comical) explanation in layman's terms: 
[Why are software development task estimations regularly off by a factor of 2-3?](https://www.quora.com/Engineering-Management/Why-are-software-development-task-estimations-regularly-off-by-a-factor-of-2-3/answer/Michael-Wolfe)
