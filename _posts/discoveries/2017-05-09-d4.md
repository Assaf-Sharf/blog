> Don’t treat your ideas like they’re nothing, don’t treat _yourself_ like 
you’re nothing, because you _and_ your ideas are important and meaningful and 
have the potential to become so much more than you realize.

[Sarah Cooper](https://twitter.com/sarahcpr) of 
[The Cooper Review](http://thecooperreview.com/about/), discusses questioning 
yourself to the point of paralysis in 
[Do You Take Yourself Seriously?](http://thecooperreview.com/take-yourself-seriously/) 
An inspirational read which I identify with, both as an artist in sharing my 
photography, poetry, and other creations, and as an individual who enjoys 
spreading ideas and information.

[8 Ways You Can Survive &mdash; And Thrive In &mdash; Midlife](http://www.npr.org/2016/03/17/469822644/8-ways-you-can-survive-and-thrive-in-midlife) 
reminds us what matters most. Always keep learning is a personal mantra. Doing 
something new and accepting some failures are paramount to keeping our brains 
(and bodies) fresh.

Inspired by the movie, [The Intern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intern_(2015_film)) 
(entertaining flick, btw), this is a great real-life example of how the 
different generations benefit from each other.

Connecting older and younger generations creates so many benefits. The Dutch 
have figured out a way to encourage cross-generational interactions, as seen in 
**My 93-year-old Flatmate**: [short 3 minute video](https://www.facebook.com/DatelineSBS/videos/10157027865085411/) 
or the [longer 22 minute video)(http://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/my-93-year-old-flatmate).

[David Grann](https://twitter.com/DavidGrann)'s exposé on the famous explorer 
and amateur archaeologist, Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, began in 2005 with 
[The Lost City of Z](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/19/the-lost-city-of-z) 
(warning, it's a lengthy read). He describes his journey retracing Fawcett's 
1925 quest through the Amazon for a lost city, a rich Amazonian civilization. 
He followed it up in 2009, with his book, 
[Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-City-Deadly-Obsession-Amazon/dp/1400078458/), 
providing even more details of the experience. The next year, in 2010, he 
published [Under the Jungle](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/under-the-jungle), 
telling of research since his 2005 story that proves the existence of an 
extensive civilization in the Amazon as far back as the third century A.D. All 
of this provides the basis for 
[the movie](http://www.bleeckerstreetmedia.com/thelostcityofz).

Artist [Ben Rubin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benrubincreative) adds 
hilariously contextual monsters to pictures of people riding the NYC subway. 
Wonderful stuff! SubwayDoodle at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/subwaydoodle/) 
and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/subwaydoodle/). Unfortunately, he 
doesn't take commissions. :(

his experiences learning about racism during his own childhood and how to 
create positive social change through parenting of his young son in 
[Race, Kids&mdash;and the Peril of Silence](http://www.quietrev.com/race-kids-peril-silence/).
