<p><p>Following October's announcement of the closure of Google+, Google's flagship social network, the company has discovered an additional bug within the network's application program interface that potentially impacts up to 52.5 million users.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/" rel="nofollow">an official Google blog post by David Thacker</a>, Vice President of Product Management for G Suite, this bug allowed third party apps and services that requested information about Google+ users, such as name, occupation, age, and email address, to have access to this information from Google+ directly even if the requested info was set to non-public access. This vulnerability was open for a six-day period.</p>
<p>On the bright side, Thacker states that the API bug &quot;did not give developers access to information such as financial data, national identification numbers, passwords, or similar data typically used for fraud or identity theft.&quot; In addition to this, he states that Google has found no evidence of third party developers noticing or exploiting this API vulnerability or of any third party having compromised Google's systems.</p>

Following the discovery of this data vulnerability, however, the closure has been rushed up to April of 2019 instead.</p>
