Welcome to my minimal blog.

My name is Marius, but I like to go with the alter ego Justus Bersten.
I work in finance and focus mainly on time series forecasting.
In my free time I like to play video games like World of Warcraft, Valorant or tft.
When I am not gaming I go for a run, bike drive or lift heavy ass weights.

Here I will write about all kinds of stuff that come to my mind.
