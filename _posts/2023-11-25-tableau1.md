## Tableau Desktop Specialist 개념 정리 

### Extract Your Data
#### Extracts are advantageous for several reasons

1. Supports large data sets: You can create extracts that contain billions of rows of data.

2. Help improve performance: When you interact with views that use extract data sources, you generally experience better performance than when interacting with views based on connections to the original data.

3. Support additional functionality: Extracts allow you to take advantage of Tableau functionality that's not available or supported by the original data, such as the ability to compute Count Distinct.

4. Provide offline access to your data: If you are using Tableau Desktop, extracts allow you to save and work with the data locally when the original data is not available. For example, when you are traveling.

5. Fast to create : If You're working with large data sets, creating and working with extracts can be faster than working with the original data.

### Tableau documentation for the various file type

(1) **.tds(Tableau Data Source)** - To not contain the actual data but rather the information necessary to connect to the actual data as well as any modification you've made on top of the actual data such as changing default properties, creating calculated field etc. 

Tableau 데이터 소스를 나타내며, 이는 실제 데이터를 포함하지 않고 대신에 실제 데이터에 연결하고 해당 데이터 위에 만든 변경 사항을 포함하는 정보를 나타냅니다. 이 변경 사항에는 기본 속성 변경, 계산된 필드 생성 등이 포함될 수 있습니다.

(2) **.twbx(Tableau packed workbook)** - To create a single zip file that contains a workbook along with any supporting local file data and background images. This is great for sharing your work with others who don't have access to the original data 

It contains viz, info needed to build the viz, and a copy of the data source. 

<i>The following files are included in packed workbooks:</i>

- Background image
- Custom geocoding
- Custom shape
- Local cube files
- Microsoft Access files
- Microsoft Excel files
- Tableau extract fiels (.hyde ore .tde)
- Text files (.csv, .txt, etc)

이는 워크북과 관련된 local 파일 데이터 및 배경 이미지를 모두 포함하는 단일한 압축 파일을 생성하는 목적으로 사용됩니다. 이것은 원본 데이터에 대한 액세스 권한이 없는 다른 사람들과 작업을 공유하는 데 유용합니다.

(3) **.Extract (.hyper or .tde)** - To create a local copy of a subset or entire data set that you can use to share data with others, when you need to work offline, and improve performance

이는 데이터 세트의 일부 또는 전체에 대한 로컬 복사본을 생성하는 데 사용됩니다. 이를 통해 데이터를 다른 사람들과 공유하거나 오프라인에서 작업하거나 성능을 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 

(4) **.twb (Workbook)** - To hold one or more worksheet plus zero or more dashboards and stories  

이 파일 형식은 하나 이상의 워크시트와 0개 이상의 대시보드 및 스토리를 포함할 수 있습니다. 

(5) **.twm (bookmark)** - To contain a single worksheet and quickly share your work

### Field

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/field.png){: .align-center} 

**Continuous** means "forming an unbroken whole, without interruption". These fields are colored **green**. When a continuous field is put on the Rows or Columns shelf, an axis is created in the view.

**Discrete** means "individually separate and distinct." These fields are colored **blue**. When a discrete field is put on the Rows or Columns shelf, a header is created in the view.

Table auto-generate **1 Dimension, 4 Measure**

1 Dimension - Measure Names

4 Dimension - Latitude, Longitude, Number of records, Measure Values 


Measure Names and  Measure Values can't be deleted in Tableau. These are auto-genearated

Calculated Fields, and Number of records can both be deleted.


### Icon

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/type_icon.png){: .align-center} 


### Reference Line 

  You can add a reference line at a **constant or computed value** on the axis. Computed values can be based on a specified field : **Calculated Fields, Measures**

### Trend Line

To add trend lines to a view, both axes must contain a field that can be interpreted as a number. However, you can add a trend line to a view of sales over time because both sales and time can be interpreted as numeric values. 

For multidimensional data sources, the date hierarchies actually contain strings rather than numbers. Therefore, trend lines are not allowed. Additionally, the ‘m/d/yy’ and ‘mmmm yyyy’ date formats on all data sources do not allow trend lines.

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/trend_line2.png){: .align-center} 

There are 5 types of trend lines which we can work with in Tableau

1) Linear Trend Line

2) Logarithmic Trend Line

3) Exponential Trend Line

4) Polynomial Trend Line

5) Power Model

### Animation 

#### 1) Simultaneous animations

The default simulataneous animation are faster and work well when showing value changes in simpler charts and dashboards 

#### 2) Sequential animations 
Sequential animations take more time but make complex changes clear by presenting them step-by-step

#### To Animate visualization in a workbook

1) Choose Format > Animation

2) If you want to animate every sheet, under Workbook Default, click On. Then do the following:

3) To override workbook defaults for a particular sheet, change the settings under Selected Sheet.

### Quick table calculation

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/quick_table.png){: .align-center} 

### Story point

A story is a sheet, so the methods you use to create, name, and manage worksheets and dashboards also apply to stories (for more details, see Workbooks and Sheets). At the same time, a story is also a collection of sheets, arranged in a sequence. **Each individual sheet in a story is called a story point.**

동시에 story는 시퀀스로 정렬된 시트의 컬렉션입니다. 이야기의 각 개별 시트를 'story point'라고 합니다."

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/story_point.png){: .align-center} 

### Formatting axes

To make an axis bold, simply right click it, select format, and then click on Font to chose Bold

### Wildcard Search
Use this method to set up search criteria to automatically include tables in your union. Use the wildcard character, which is an asterisk (*), to match a sequence or pattern of characters in the Excel workbook and worksheet names, Google Sheets workbook and worksheet names, text file names, JSON file names, .pdf file names, and database table names.

검색 기준을 설정하여 자동으로 연합에 테이블을 포함할 수 있습니다. 와일드카드 문자인 별표(*)를 사용하여 Excel 워크북 및 워크시트 이름, Google Sheets 워크북 및 워크시트 이름, 텍스트 파일 이름, JSON 파일 이름, .pdf 파일 이름 및 데이터베이스 테이블 이름의 일련의 문자 또는 패턴과 일치시킬 수 있습니다.

### Mark Card

The marks Card allow us not only to edit the Shape, Text and Color, but also to modify the Tooltip and the level of detail of the visualisation

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/mark_card.png){: .align-center}

### Grouping data

#### Ways to group data
1) Marks
2) Labels
3) Dimensions shelf

<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/group_data1.png" width="400" />
    <img src="{{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/group_data2.png" width="400" width="400" />
</div>

### Data Blending

**Data blending** simulates a tranditional **left join** . The main difference between the two is when the aggregation is performed. A join combines the data and then aggregates, A blend aggregated and the combines the data

Data blending is performed on a **sheet-by-sheet** basis and is established when a field from a second data source is used in the view

Primary ata source appears with a Blue tick-mark and the secondary data source appears with a Orange tick-mark.

### Mark Label

#### Show mark label
1) Click on Show Mark Labels Icon in Toolbar
2) Drag the measure to the Text label in the Marks Card
3) Click on Analysis -> Show mark labels from the Tableau menu bar 

### Color palette
Discrete field on Color in the Marks card, Tableau displays a categorical palette and assigns a color to each value of field

Continuous field on Color, Tableau displays a quantiative(정량적) legend with a continuous range of colors . 

### Dashboard device option
#### Which of the following Device options are available in the Device Preview section 

Phone, Monitor, Laptop, Default

### Union 
Union is a method for appending values (rows) to table. you can use this method if both tables have the same columns

### Header, Axis

Dimensions can only create header. Measures will create header axis both.

### 2020.1 version

#### 2020.1 version the new features 

1) Viz animation
2) Dynamic Parameter
3) Buffer Calculations

Set controls are new feature introduced in 2020.2 version

### Role, Type

When users connected to Tableau, the data fields in their data set are automatically assigned a role and a type.

#### Role
1) Dimension
2) Measure
#### Type
1) String
2) Number
3) Geographic
4) Boolean
5) Date
6) Date and Time 

When users connected a nre data source, Tableau assigns each field in the data source as dimension or measure in the Data pane

### Table calculation

Runnung Total, Percent Difference, Difference, Percent if Total, Rank, Percentile

### Aggregate function

Sum, AVG, Median, Count, Min, Max, Percentile, Std, Variance


### Bin 
It's sometimes useful to convert a **continuous measure**(or a **nemeric dimension**) into bins.

### Filter
#### Create filter

#### Order of Operations  
![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/order_of_operations.png){: .align-center}

#### Context filter
1) Improve performance - If you set a lot of filters or have a large data source, the queries can be slow. You can set one or more context filters to improve performance.

2) Create a dependent numerical or top N filter - You can set a context filter to include only the data of interest, and then set a numerical or top N filter. 


### Quick Filter 

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/quick_filter.png){: .align-center}

### Set

Sets are custom fields that are **created** within Tableau Desktop **based on dimensions** from your data source. Either dimensions or measures can be used to determine whqt is included or excluded from a set using conditional logic


#### To create a dynamic set
1) In the Data pane, right click a dimension and select Create > Set

2) In the Create Set dialog box, configure your set. You can configure your set using the following tabs

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/set.png){: .align-center}


### Copy Image
1) By clicking on Worksheet in the Tableau Main Menu above, and choosing Copy->Image

2) By right clicking on the worksheet visualisation and selecting Copy -> Image

### Data pane 
![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/data_pane_.png){: .align-center .img-height-half}

### Analytics pane

**Dimension fields** - Fields that contain qualitative (정성적) values (such as names, dates, or geographical data). Dimensions affect the level of detail in the view. 

**Measure fields** - Fields that contain numeric, quantitative(정략적) values can be measured. (such as Sales, profit ..)

**Calculated field** - You can create new fields in Tableau using calculations and then save them as part of your data source. 

**Sets** - Subsets of data that you define. Sets are custom fields based on exsiting dimension and criteria that you specify. 

**Parameters** - Values that can be used as placeholders in formulas, or replace constant values in calculated fields and filters.

### Aliases

You can create aliases for members in a dimension so that their labels appear differently in the view.

Aliases can be created for the members of **discrete dimensions only**. They cannot be created for continuous dimensions, dates, or measure**



### Chart 

![Alt text]({{site.url}}/images/2023-11-25-tableau1/chart.png){: .align-center .img-width-half} 

- Bullet graph
A bullet graph is a variation of a bar graph developed to replace dashboard gauges and meters. A bullet graph is useful for comparing the performance of a **primary measure to one or more other measures.**

- Pareto Chart
Pareto Chart is a type of contains both bars and line graph, where individual values are represented in decending order by bars, and aecending cumulative total is represented by the line

- Histogram
A histogram is a chart that displays the shape of distribution. A histogram looks like a bar chart but groups values for a continuous measure into ranges, or bins.

- Line Chart
Line charts connect individual data points in a view. They provided a simple wqy to visualize a sequence of values and are useful when you want to see trends over time

### Dashboard 

#### Action
1) Select
- Filtering
2) Hover
- Highlighting
3) Menu
- added to the tooltip and user can decided whether to run that action or not
