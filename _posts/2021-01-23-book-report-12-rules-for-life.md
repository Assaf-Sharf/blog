# Overview

Here I will capture some of the key points and lessons for “12 Rules for Life” by Jordan Peterson. The purpose of this book report is to remind my future self of the lessons I have learned. I will attempt to stay away from bullet notes and instead try to tie together the various lessons I have learned. I hope you enjoy it and feel free to leave comments with your thoughts, interpretations, ideas, and whatever else comes to mind.

# Chapter 1: Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulder Back

## The Lobsters

In this chapter, Jordan Peterson starts off by talking of lobsters, and the way they compete for dominance. The most dominant lobsters win the best territory, which provides them with the best food sources, keeps them safe from predators, and brings in all of the ladies. To be the most dominant lobster, lobsters must assert their dominance over each other. The most dominant lobsters rise to the top, and live life comfortably, while the least dominant lobsters stay at the bottom.

Jordan Peterson talks about how the dominant lobsters have a higher perception of their self and a higher perception of their position in the dominance hierarchy. This higher perception of self and standing in society releases serotonin, which in turn increases their confidence and helps them be more dominant. The opposite is true for the losing lobster. Once they have lost, their perception of their standing in the dominance hierarchy, and of themselves decreases. This limits the amount of serotonin that is released, which in turn, makes it harder for them to compete with the dominant lobsters.

Peterson talks further on the lasting effects of the losing lobsters. Now that they have a lower perception of themselves, they are going to be less likely to put themselves in a situation where they will compete with a dominant lobster. The last time they went down that route they lost, and they are afraid of being in danger. In fact, a losing lobster is far more likely to retreat at the thought of danger.

In this way, lobsters establish a hierarchy. They determine who they can push around and messed with, and who is going to stand their ground and fight. The ladies know who they want to mate with. The lobsters at the top of the hierarchy get more than those at the bottom.

## Nature Selects Fitness

Peterson speaks of Yin and Yang. He does so in the concept of order and chaos, and how they are circling each other. He states “This is because order and chaos are interchangeable, as well as eternally juxtaposed. There is nothing so certain that it cannot vary.”

Peterson does a wonderful job at explaining the reality of natural selection. A key concept is explaining that nature is **not** static. The environment of nature constantly changes, affecting those who are adapting and living within it. This means that the environment which makes up nature is not constant as time evolves. If it was, it would mean that the evolution of the species living within it would also be constant. But as we know that is not the case.

The environment of nature itself is _constantly_ changing, meaning that species have to evolve to the flow and current of nature. As nature changes, the features that a species needs to be successful within it must also change. In this way, creatures are in a dance with nature, as nature changes, so must they, just to survive. Peterson quotes the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland, “you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place.” In essence, nature changes, as it changes, it selects the fit who are able to adapt to its changes.

### Layers Of Nature

Peterson also reminds us that nature is not simply dynamic either. Some things change faster than others. He gives a beautiful example to capture this, “Leaves change more quickly than trees, and trees more quickly than forests.” He then goes on to explain the importance of this. “If it wasn’t this way, then the conservatism of evolution would not work, as the basic morphology of arms and hands would have to change as fast as the length of arm bones and the function of fingers.” He explains, “chaos, within order within chaos, within a higher order. The order that is most real is the order that is most unchanging-and that is not necessarily the order that is most easily seen.” He wraps up the concept and touches on his main point perfectly with, “The leaf, when perceived, might blind the observer of the tree. The tree can blind him to the forest. And some things that are most real (such as the ever-present dominance hierarchy) cannot be seen.

### Romanticizing Nature

Oftentimes we find ourselves romanticizing nature by focusing solely on its beauty. But in reality, the environment of nature can be very ugly. Peterson says, “Unfortunately, ‘the environment’ is also elephantiasis and guinea worms (don’t ask), anopheles mosquitoes and malaria, starvation-level droughts, AIDS and the Black Plague.” He explains that not only do we not fantasize about these things, but due to these things, we have modified our surroundings, have built cities, transportation, grow food and generate power. “If Mother Nature wasn’t so hell-bent on our destruction it would be easier for us to exist in simple harmony with her dictates.”

This brings Peterson to his main point of nature, “that nature is something strictly segregated from the cultural constructs that have emerged within it. The order within the chaos and the order of Being is ‘what selects,' and the longer a feature has existed the more time it has had to be selected - and to shape life.” Relating this to his earlier point of the dominance hierarchy, “All that matters, from a Darwinian perspective, is permanence - and the dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.”

Peterson believes and explains how the dominance hierarchy is not something that we have made up through culture or society. Instead, it is something that has been within us (us, as in life), for a very long time. He claims that “Dominance hierarchies are older than trees”. Due to this, the part of our brain which calculates where we fit into this dominance hierarchy is “ancient and fundamental.”

### How This Translates to Us

Like our fellow lobsters, the dominance hierarchy has very similar effects in our lives. When we feel defeated we have traits similar to the lobsters who have lost a fight. “Our posture droops. We face the ground. We feel threatened, hurt, anxious, and weak.” In situations like this, we are not able to fight back against life, which can lead to anxiety and depression. It can led to use being easy targets for “harder-shelled bullies.”

For low-ranking human beings, low serotonin has negative effects. It means lower self-confidence, less happiness, more pain, anxiety, illness, and usually a lower life span. When you’re low, it's easier to stay low and harder to build yourself back up.

## Our Dominance Calculator

As stated, we all have an ancient counter in our brains which calculates where we stand on the dominance hierarchy. Peterson does so by having a scale from 1-10, 1 being most dominant, 10 being least. Our brain has various ways of calculating where we stand on the hierarchy. One way is by noticing how you are treated by others. If others respect you and treat you well, then it increases your self-confidence, and your brain positions you at a higher level.

### The Effects of Being at the Bottom

On the other hand, if you are not treated well by your peers, your brain will put you at the lower end of the scale. This will lead your brain to release less serotonin, which will negatively impact you. When you’re at the bottom of the scale, you are more susceptible to reacting to the smallest of unexpected emergencies, which can happen more often at the bottom.

By constantly reacting to the negative events around you, mostly in an emotional state, you will drain your energy. While someone at the top of the scale would be more confident in their ability to access the situation and react accordingly. Peterson states, “When you don't know what to do, you must be prepared to do anything and everything, in case it becomes necessary. You’re sitting in your car with the gas and brake pedals both punched to the mat.”

This ancient counter can even shut down your immune system if it believes it needs to exert all of its energy to an emergency now, instead of preserving energy for later. This can render you impulsive, and make you do things for short term pleasures that you might consider disgraceful in the future. When you’re not accustomed to winning, you will take any win possible. Peterson says, “The physical demands of emergency preparedness will wear you down in every way.”

He closes off the thought by stating how those at the top of the scale act very differently. Peterson says, “It (the counter) thinks the chances that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of a disaster.” You have a higher level of serotonin, which renders you calm and collected during stressful situations, which will help you resolve them in a better manner. You are confident and less alert than your lower standing counterparts. Since your future is secure your more likely to think of the long term, delay gratification, and ultimately are a reliable and thoughtful person.

### The Counter Malfunctioning

The counter within us is also able to malfunction, and there are various things that can cause this. Poor eating and sleeping patterns can negatively affect its functionality. He speaks of the importance of routine, and how routine turns the things we do into habits, and how these habits help to shape the best versions of ourselves.

#### Feedback Loops

Perhaps one of the most fascinating parts of the chapter was the one of the feedback loop. Peterson explains the general concept of a feedback loop as such, “A positive feedback loop requires an input detector, an amplified, and some form of output. Imagine a signal picked up by the input detector, amplified, and then emitted, in amplified form…. The trouble starts when the input detector detects the output, and runs it through the system again, amplifying and emitting it again. A few rounds of intensification and things get dangerously out of control.”

Peterson explains this concept by taking a dive into alcoholism and agoraphobia. Both of which are very fascinating. With alcoholism, once alcoholics start drinking, their blood alcohol levels spike, they continue to chase this feeling by drinking. Once they stop, their body starts to metabolize the ethanol. They start experiencing withdrawal. This is soon followed by a hangover. Alcohol is the input, they feel better as the alcohol levels spike, the amplifier, and the output is withdrawal and a hangover.

The real problem occurs when the output, the hangover, realizes that it can be cured by drinking alcohol, the input. This is known as the hair of the dog. This can create a _positive_ feedback loop. As you drink, you feel withdrawal, so you drink more, which leads to a killer hangover, which is cured by…. you guessed it, drinking alcohol.

Peterson goes onto to explain how people who are depressed can feel burdensome and useless, as well as grief-stricken and pained. They then detach themselves from family and friends, which can lead to them feeling more lonely and burdensome. This loop continues and amplifies.

He also touches upon bully-victims and the lasting effect this has on their counter. People who were severely bullied in their youth can carry that trauma with them as they grow older. “They become anxious and easily upset. They shield themselves with a defensive crouch and avoid the direct eye contact interpretable as a dominance challenge…. This means that the damage caused by the bullying (the lowering of status and confidence) can continue, even after the bullying has ended.”

In some cases, when a person constantly feels scared, threatened, anxious and subordinate, they carry themselves with a slouched posture, they avoid direct eye contact. This can attract people who were once bullies to them, and cause the bullying to happen again. Although it might not be physical anymore and verbal instead, the effect is the same, it lowers the victim's perception of their position in the dominance hierarchy. With this low belief in self, accompanied by the way they carry themselves, it doesn’t matter if they relocate or change jobs, they will always attract bullies, which will keep them at the bottom of the hierarchy.

## Rising Up

Peterson talks about the difference between those who _can’t_ fight back, and those who _won’t_ fight back. Those who can’t fight back might be smaller in size and weaker than their opponents. But those who _won’t_ fight back can be people who are very compassionate and self-sacrificing. It can also be by people who have decided that all forms of aggression are wrong. These people can suppress their aggression due to their overt compassion and self-sacrificing beliefs, which are naive and exploitable.

Those who say no early in the cycle of oppression, limit the extent of oppression by the oppressor. Peterson states, “The forces of tyranny expand inexorably to fill the space made available for their existence.” You should always stand your ground and not allow others to take advantage of you.

Those who have the naive belief that aggression is wrong have a few basic beliefs, “People are basically good; no one really wants to hurt anyone else, the threat (and, certainly, the use) of force, physical or otherwise, is wrong.” Those who have this naive conception of the world oftentimes invite the malevolent. Those who are looking to harm others have developed a sensor for those who will allow it.

### Finding Your Aggression

Peterson talks of the things he does in his own clinical practice to combat this. He shows those with this naive belief of the resentment and anger they are capable of. He then helps them redirect it into standing up for themselves.

He states that in some cases, people are shocked by this, sometimes severely. He uses certain cases of PTSD, where soldiers sometimes perform acts during war they did not know they were able of. These acts are sometimes things they considered undoable, perhaps they considered these actions to only be performed by those they viewed as evil. Nonetheless, the reality that they are capable of doing this can haunt them. These individuals usually grow up in a bubble and believe that the world is a fairy tale where nothing bad can ever happen.

Once people realize the aggression they are capable of, they start to stand up for themselves, they **demand** respect, and in turn, develop self-respect. They walk around with more confidence, they ditch their hunched posture which they previously shared with the defeated lobster. They have realized that if they don't stand up for themselves, they will resent themselves, and feed into self-destruction. Peterson believes, “There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.”

### How to Stand Up Tall

You might realize that you’re a loser, or that you have bad traits or a collection of bad traits, that doesn’t mean that you have to stay that way. You must realize this within yourself, that is the first step of overcoming and changing. “If you slump around, with the same bearing that characterizes a defeated lobster, people will assign you a lower status, and the older counter that you share with crustaceans, sitting at the very base of your brain, will assign you a low dominance number.” This will affect your levels of serotonin, will stop you from standing up for yourself, and ultimately cripple your chances of living life in the best circumstances.

As feedback loops can affect your life in a negative way, you can also develop feedback loops that do the opposite. A good example is by fixing your posture and facing the world with your chest out and chin up. “If your posture is poor, for example - if you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual - then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.” If you present yourself as defeated, then the world will perceive you as such. “If you straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.”

#### More Than Just Physically

Having good posture might not be the solution to all your problems, and it might not get you out of the bottom of the dominance hierarchy. Peterson states, “But standing up straight with your shoulder back is not something that is only physical, because you’re not only a body. _You’re a spirit_, so to speak - a psyche - as well. Standing up physically also implies and invokes and demands standing up metaphysically. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being. Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe. You see the gold the dragon hoards, instead of shrinking in terror from the all-too-real fact of the dragon. You step forward to take your place in the dominance hierarchy, and occupy your territory, manifesting your willingness to defend, expand and transform it. That can all occur practically or symbolically, as a physical or as a conceptual restructuring…. To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open.”

You must stop being afraid of demanding what is yours by right, in essence, what is everyone's by right. You are the master of your own fate, and you need to face that realization head-on. You shouldn’t be naive and under the notion that being aggressive is negative, especially when you’re being aggressive in demanding respect from the world.

Peterson says, “So attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around. Speak your mind. Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them - at least the same right as others. Walk tall and gaze forthrightly ahead. Dare to be dangerous. Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.”

This belief in yourself with rub off on others. They will believe you to be competent at what you do. You will meet new people and have better social interactions. Good things will start to happen to you more often, and you will appreciate them more as well.

When adversity does strike, it won’t send you into a spiral, you will be able to handle it head-on. You won’t be afraid of danger, instead you will be ready to stand up to it. You will become the strength for others.

It is your right to live the best life possible. You are capable of doing great things and having the best in life. The best territory, the best food, and the best mate. You are deserving, all you must do is stand tall, and get it. Muster up the strength and courage to approach the world with your eye on the prize. Peterson closes off the chapter with, “Look for your inspiration to the victorious lobster, with its 350 million years of practical wisdom. Stand up straight, with your shoulders back.”
