## How to link JavaScript with HTML

Today, I learned how to link JavaScript file with HTML using DOM (Document Obejct Model).

-With HTML, we can make the structure of the webpage.
-With CSS, we can design the structures to how we want them to be.
-And with JavaScript, we implement the fuctions that interacts with the webpage.

### My code for today

This is the basic example of how to link JavaScript file with HTML. 
For HTML, there should be a line with ```<script>``` tag to bring the JavaScript file, and tag id to select where the functions should be implemented.

This is the practice code for the HTML:
```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
    <script src="./04-document.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="target">Hello</div>
    <button onclick="changeWord2()">button</button>
    <button onclick="changeWord()">button2</button>
    <input id="input">
</body>
</html>
```
Basically, there is just a text saying "Hello", an input space, and two buttons in the webpage.
And I included couple of functions through JavaScript:
```js
function changeWord() {
    document.getElementById("input").value = "World"
}

function changeWord2() {
    document.getElementById("target").innerText = "World"
}
```
chageWord() just adds the word "World" to the empty input when button2 is clicked, and changeWord2() changes the word "Hello" to the word "World" when button is clicked.
I will implement this logistics to the Cyworld Project to put a little more advanced function.
