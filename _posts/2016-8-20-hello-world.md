And after months of procrastinating, I have finally set up my own *real* blog! 

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
"Hello, world!"
```

This blog was previously located on [branded.me](https://branded.me/harshgadgil/posts). Although branded.me has made it a piece of cake for anyone to start their own blog, it didn't feel very flexible and *programmer-friendly*.

Jekyll is impressive, and I'm not so easily impressed! Setting up this blog has not been easily, but it has been fun! Jekyll is incredibly powerful, and I'm going to enjoy blogging using Markdown!
