And after months of procrastinating, I have finally set up my own *real* blog! 

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
"Hello, world!"
```

This blog was previously located on [branded.me](https://branded.me/harshgadgil/posts). Although branded.me has made it a piece of cake for anyone to start their own blog, it didn't feel very flexible and *programmer-friendly*.

Jekyll is impressive, and I'm not so easily impressed! Setting up this blog has been a breeze.
