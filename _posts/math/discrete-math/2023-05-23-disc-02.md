# 2.2 Venn Diagrams and Subsets

Venn Diagrams and Subsets

## Set

A collection of distinct objects. Each member of the set is called element of the set.

Sets are designated using the following three methods:

1. Word description,For Example: The set of even counting numbers less than 10
2. The listing method, For Example: {2, 4, 6, 8}
3. Set-builder notation, For Example: {x l x is an even counting number less than 10}

Note that:

- Sets are denoted by capital letters.
- Empty set or null set is the set with no element and is denoted by ∅ or { }
- ∈ : is a symbol that reads as “ ELEMENT”,
- ∉ : is a symbol that reads as “NOT AN ELEMENT”

> Example 1:
>
> 1. A= {x|x is odd counting number less than 10}
> 2. A={1,3,5,7,9}
> 3. 5 ∈ A, 5 is an element of set A
> 4. 6 ∉ A , is not an element of set A

<br>

## Empty set

The set containing no elements is called the empty set, or null set. The symbol ∅ is used to denote the empty set, so ∅ and { } have the same meaning. We do not denote the empty set with the symbol {∅} because this notation represents a set with one element.

<br>

## Subsets

### 1. Subset:

Set A is subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B. Symbolically A ⊆ B

> Example 1:
>
> If A = {a,b,c} and B = {c,b,a}, then A ⊆ B

> Example 2:
>
> Write ⊆ or ⊈ in each blank to make a true statement.
>
> - {3,4,5,6} ? {3,4,5,6,8} &rarr; Therefore, {3,4,5,6} ⊆ {3,4,5,6,8}
> - {1,2,6} ? {2,4,6,8} &rarr; Therefore, {1,2,6} ⊈ {2,4,6,8}
> - {5,6,7,8} ? {6,5,8,7} &rarr; Therefore, {5,6,7,8} ⊆ {6,5,8,7}

### 2. Proper Subsets:

Set A is a proper subset of B if A ⊆ B and 𝐴 ≠ 𝐵. Symbolically A ⊂ B

> Example 1:
>
> If A = {a,b,c} and B = {a,b,c,d}, then A ⊂ B

> Example 2:
>
> Decide whether ⊆, ⊂, or both could be placed in each blank to make a true statement.
>
> - {5,6,7} ? {5,6,7,8} &rarr; Therefore, {5,6,7} ⊂ {5,6,7,8}
> - {a,b,c} ? {a,b,c} &rarr; Therefore, {a,b,c} ⊆ {a,b,c}

<br>

## Set equality

Set A = B if and only if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A

> Example 1:
>
> If A = {1,2,3} and B = {3,1,2}, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, therefore A = B

<br>

## Number of Subsets

### 1. Number of Subsets

The number of subsets of a set is given by 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the cardinal number.

### 2. Number of Proper Subsets

The number of proper subsets of a set is given by 2<sup>n</sup> − 1 where n is the cardinal number.

> Example 1:
>
> Find the number of subsets and proper subsets of A= {w,x,y,z}
>
> - Number of subsets: 2<sup>4</sup> = 16
> - Number of proper subsets: 2<sup>4</sup> - 1 = 15

> Example 2:
>
> Find all possible subsets of a set {a,b,c} by trial and error.
>
> Here, trial and error leads to eight subsets for {a,b,c}: ∅ , {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}, {a,b,c}.
>
> An alternative method involves drawing a tree diagram

>
> - Number of subsets: 2<sup>3</sup> = 8
> - Number of proper subsets: 2<sup>3</sup> - 1 = 7

## Universal Set

The set containing all objects or elements and of which all other sets are subsets. The symbol U is used to denote the universal set.

<br>

## The Complement of a Set A

The set of elements of U that are not elements of A. Symbolically A' = {x|x ∈ U and x ∉ A}

> Example 1:
>
> Find each set a)M' b)N'
>
> Let U = {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}, M = {a,b,e,f}, and N = {b,d,e,g,h}.
>
> - a) M' = {c,d,g,h}
> - b) N' = {a,c,f}

<br>

## Venn Diagram

Venn diagram of universal set U is represented by the rectangle and any subset A of U is represented by an oval. The region inside U and outside the oval represents A'.

> Example 1:
>
> Let U = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, A = {2,3,5,6}
>
> - What is: A', the complement of A? Therefore A' = {1, 4, 7, 8}
> - What is U', the complement of U? Therefore U' = ∅
> - What is ∅', the complement of ∅? Therefore ∅' = U

> Example 2:
>
> If U = {a,b,c,...,z}, A = {a,b,c}, and B = {a,b,c,d}, then A ⊂ B
>
> Venn diagram for A ⊂ B is depicted in the figure below.
