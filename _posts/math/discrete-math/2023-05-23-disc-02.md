# 2.2 Venn Diagrams and Subsets

## Set

A collection of distinct objects. Each member of the set is called element of the set.

Sets are designated using the following three methods:

1. Word description,For Example: The set of even counting numbers less than 10
2. The listing method, For Example: {2, 4, 6, 8}
3. Set-builder notation, For Example: {x l x is an even counting number less than 10}

Note that:

- Sets are denoted by capital letters.
- Empty set or null set is the set with no element and is denoted by ∅ or { }
- ∈ : is a symbol that reads as “ ELEMENT”,
- ∉ : is a symbol that reads as “NOT AN ELEMENT”

> Example 1:
>
> 1. A= {x|x is odd counting number less than 10}
> 2. A={1,3,5,7,9}
> 3. 5 ∈ A, 5 is an element of set A
> 4. 6 ∉ A , is not an element of set A

<br>

# Empty set

The set containing no elements is called the empty set, or null set. The symbol ∅ is used to denote the empty set, so ∅ and { } have the same meaning. We do not denote the empty set with the symbol {∅} because this notation represents a set with one element.

<br>

# Subsets

## Subset:

Set A is subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B. Symbolically A ⊆ B

> Example 1:
>
> If A = {a,b,c} and B = {c,b,a}, then A ⊆ B

> Example 2:
>
> Write ⊆ or ⊈ in each blank to make a true statement
>
> - {3,4,5,6} ? {3,4,5,6,8} &rarr; Therefore, {3,4,5,6} ⊆ {3,4,5,6,8}
> - {1,2,6} ? {2,4,6,8} &rarr; Therefore, {1,2,6} ⊈ {2,4,6,8}
> - {5,6,7,8} ? {6,5,8,7} &rarr; Therefore, {5,6,7,8} ⊆ {6,5,8,7}
