# 1.1 Solving Problems by Inductive Reasoning

A conjecture is an educated guess based on repeated observations of a particular process or pattern.

## Inductive reasoning

Inductive reasoning is the process of making generalized conclusion or conjectures after observing repeated process or patterns. The conjecture made by inductive reasoning may not be always true. A counter example proves the conjecture is false.

> Example: The day before yesterday was sunny. Yesterday was sunny. Today is sunny so tomorrow will be sunny. If tomorrow is sunny then the conjecture made is true.

> Example (Counter Example): 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 are prime numbers (the number which is divisible only by itself and one is a prime number). So all prime numbers are odd.

## Deductive reasoning

Deductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions from given facts, general principles, definitions and properties. Deductive reasoning usually follows steps. First, there is a premise (major premise), then a second premise (minor premise), and finally a conclusion.

Premise: A premise can be an assumption, law, rule, widely held idea, or observation. Then, reason inductively or deductively from the premises to obtain a conclusion. The premises and conclusion make up a logical argument.

> Example: All college graduates are hired fulltime within one year of graduation (major premise). Mark is graduating in 2018 (minor premise). He will be a fulltime employee by the end of 2019 (conclusion).

> Example: All prime numbers are divisible only by itself and one (major premise). 23 is a prime number (minor premise). 23 is divisible by 23(conclusion).

> Example: Identifying inductive or deductive reasoning
>
> Identify each premise and the conclusion in each of the following arguments. Then tell whether each argument is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning.
>
> - a) Our house is made of brick. Both of my next-door neighbors have brick houses. Therefore, all houses in our neighborhood are made of brick.
> - b) All keyboards have the symbol @. I have a keyboard. My keyboard has the symbol @.
> - c) Today is Tuesday. Tomorrow will be Wednesday.
>
> Solution:
>
> - a) The premises are “Our house is made of brick” and “Both of my next-door neighbors have brick houses.” The conclusion is “Therefore, all houses in our neighborhood are made of brick.” Because the reasoning goes from specific examples to a general statement, the argument is an example of inductive reasoning (although it may very well be faulty).
> - b) Here the premises are “All keyboards have the symbol @” and “I have a keyboard.” The conclusion is “My keyboard has the symbol @.” This reasoning goes from general to specific, so deductive reasoning was used.
> - c) There is only one premise here, “Today is Tuesday.” The conclusion is “Tomorrow will be Wednesday.” The fact that Wednesday immediately follows Tuesday is being used, even though this fact is not explicitly stated. Because the conclusion comes from general facts that apply to this special case, deductive reasoning was used.

> Example: Predicting the Next Number in a Sequence Use inductive reasoning to determine the probable next number in the list below.
>
> 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29
>
> Solution:
>
> - Each number in the list is obtained by adding 4 to the previous number.
> - The probable next number is 29 + 4 = 33.

> Example: Predicting the Product of Two Numbers

> Use the list of equations and inductive reasoning to predict the next multiplication fact in the list:
>
> - 37 X 3 = 111
> - 37 X 6 = 222
> - 37 X 9 = 333
> - 37 X 12 = 444

# 1.1 Solving Problems by Inductive Reasoning - Practice

## 1. Identifying inductive or deductive reasoning

1. The next number in the pattern 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 is 12.
2. To find the perimeter P of a square with side of length s, I can use the formula P = 4s. So the perimeter of a square with side of length 7 inches is 4 X 7 = 28 inches.
3. It has rained every day for the past six days, and it is raining today as well. So it will also rain tomorrow.
4. If you take your medicine, you’ll feel a lot better. You take your medicine. Therefore, you’ll feel a lot better.
5. Carrie’s first five children were boys. If she has another baby, it will be a boy.
6. If the same number is subtracted from both sides of a true equation, the new equation is also true. I know that 9 + 18 = 27. Therefore, (9 + 18) - 13 = 27 - 13.
7. In the sequence 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, … , the most probable next number is 30.
8. If you build it, they will come. You build it. Therefore, they will come.

## 2. Determine the most probable next term in each of the following lists of numbers.

1. 6, 9, 12, 15, 18
2. 13, 18, 23, 28, 33
3. 3, 12, 48, 192, 768
4. 32, 16, 8, 4, 2
5. 3, 6, 9, 15, 24, 39
6. 1/3, 3/5, 5/7, 7/9, 9/11

## 3. Use the list of equations and inductive reasoning to predict the next equation, and then verify your conjecture.

| 1                       | 2                    | 3                       |
| :---------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| (1 X 9) + 2 = 11        | 15873 X 7 = 111,111  | 11 X 11 = 121           |
| (12 X 9) + 3 = 111      | 15873 X 14 = 222,222 | 111 X 111 = 12,321      |
| (123 X 9) + 4 = 1111    | 15873 X 21 = 333,333 | 1111 X 1111 = 1,234,321 |
| (1234 X 9) + 5 = 11,111 | 15873 X 28 = 444,444 |                         |

| 4                       | 5                                             | 6                             |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| 2 = 4 - 2               | 5(6) = 6(6 - 1)                               | 3 = 3(3 - 1)/2                |
| 2 + 4 = 8 - 2           | 5(6) + 5(36) = 6(36 - 1)                      | 3 + 9 = 3(9 - 1)/2            |
| 2 + 4 + 8 = 16 - 2      | 5(6) + 5(36) + 5(216) = 6(216 - 1)            | 3 + 9 + 27 = 3(27 - 1)/2      |
| 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 32 - 2 | 5(6) + 5(36) + 5(216) + 5(1296) = 6(1296 - 1) | 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 3(81 - 1)/2 |

# 1.2 An Application of Inductive Reasoning: Number Patterns

Number Sequences are defined as an ordered list of numbers. Each number in the sequences is defined as a term. For example: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ...

We will focus only on two types of number sequences:

1. Arithmetic Sequence
2. Geometric Sequence

## Arithmetic Sequence

Arithmetic Sequence is the sequence in which the difference between two consecutive terms is constant. The constant difference between two consecutive terms is called common difference.

> Example: 6, 8, 10, 12, …. Is an arithmetic sequence
>
> Common difference equal to 2 (8-6, 10-8, 12-10, ...)

## Geometric Sequence

Geometric Sequence is the sequence in which the ratio between two consecutive terms is constant. The constant ratio between two consecutive terms is called common ratio.

> Example: 6, 18, 54, 162, … is a geometric sequence
>
> Common ratio equal to 3, that is 18/6 or 54/18 or 162/54

## Successive Differences

Successive Differences: In some cases, to make a conjecture about the next term method of successive differences may be applied.

> Example: 14, 22, 32, 44, ...
> ![Image](../../../assets/images/successive_dif.png)
> Once the row of 2s was obtained and extended, we were able to obtain 12 + 2 = 14, and 44 + 14 = 58 as shown above. The next number in the sequence is 58.

## Number Patterns and Sum Formulas

1. Sum of the first n odd counting numbers: If n is any counting number, then the following is true.
   : 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n<sup>2</sup>
   : - Example: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = [___] Number of terms n = 6. Therefore, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = n<sup>2</sup> = 6<sup>2</sup> = 36
2. Sum of the First n Counting Numbers: If n is any counting number, then the following is true.
   : 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n =
   $$ {n(n + 1)} \over {2} $$
   : - Example: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = [___] Number of terms n = 6. Therefore, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 6(6+1)/2 = 21
3. Square of Sum of the Counting Numbers: If n is any counting number, then the following is true.
   : (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n)<sup>2</sup> = 1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + ... + n<sup>3</sup>
   : - Example: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)<sup>2</sup> = 1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + 4<sup>3</sup> = 100

## Figurate Number

A figurate number is a number that can be shown by taking dots, and arranging them into a regular shape, such as a triangle or a pentagon. They are also called polygonal numbers because they are arranged to form various polygons.

Example: Use the formula to find each of the following.

a) Fifth triangular number

T<sub>5</sub> =
$$ {5(5 + 1)} \over {2} $$
= 15

b) Eighth square number

S<sub>8</sub> = 8<sup>2</sup> = 64

c) Fourth pentagonal number

P<sub>4</sub> =
$$ {5(3 X 5 - 1)} \over {2} $$
= 35

# 1.2 An Application of Inductive Reasoning: Number Patterns - Practice

## 1. For each of the following sequence, give the next term in the sequence.

| 1                      | 2                      | 3                         |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------ |
| 6, 16, 26, 36, 46, ... | 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, ... | 2, 12, 72, 432, 2592, ... |

| 4                     | 5                            | 6                         |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, ... | 4096, 1024, 256, 64, 16, ... | 10, 50, 90, 130, 170, ... |

## 2. Use the method of successive differences to determine the next number in each sequence.

| 1                           | 2                            | 3                                | 4                                       |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| 3, 14, 31, 54, 83, 118, ... | 1, 11, 35, 79, 149, 251, ... | 2, 57, 220, 575, 1230, 2317, ... | 3, 19, 165, 771, 2503, 6483, 14409, ... |

## 3. Determine what the next equation would be, and verify that it is indeed a true statement.
