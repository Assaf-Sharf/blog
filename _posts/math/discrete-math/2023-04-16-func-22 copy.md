# 1.1 Solving Problems by Inductive Reasoning:

A conjecture is an educated guess based on repeated observations of a particular process or pattern.

## Inductive reasoning

Inductive reasoning is the process of making generalized conclusion or conjectures after observing repeated process or patterns. The conjecture made by inductive reasoning may not be always true. A counter example proves the conjecture is false.

> Example: The day before yesterday was sunny. Yesterday was sunny. Today is sunny so tomorrow will be sunny. If tomorrow is sunny then the conjecture made is true.

> Example (Counter Example): 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 are prime numbers (the number which is divisible only by itself and one is a prime number). So all prime numbers are odd.

## Deductive reasoning

Deductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions from given facts, general principles, definitions and properties. Deductive reasoning usually follows steps. First, there is a premise (major premise), then a second premise (minor premise), and finally a conclusion.

Premise: A premise can be an assumption, law, rule, widely held idea, or observation. Then, reason inductively or deductively from the premises to obtain a conclusion. The premises and conclusion make up a logical argument.

> Example: All college graduates are hired fulltime within one year of graduation (major premise). Mark is graduating in 2018 (minor premise). He will be a fulltime employee by the end of 2019 (conclusion).

> Example: All prime numbers are divisible only by itself and one (major premise). 23 is a prime number (minor premise). 23 is divisible by 23(conclusion).

> Example: Identifying inductive or deductive reasoning
>
> Identify each premise and the conclusion in each of the following arguments. Then tell whether each argument is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning.
>
> - a) Our house is made of brick. Both of my next-door neighbors have brick houses. Therefore, all houses in our neighborhood are made of brick.
> - b) All keyboards have the symbol @. I have a keyboard. My keyboard has the symbol @.
> - c) Today is Tuesday. Tomorrow will be Wednesday.
>   Solution:
>   a) The premises are “Our house is made of brick” and “Both of my next-door neighbors have
>   brick houses.” The conclusion is “Therefore, all houses in our neighborhood are made of
>   brick.” Because the reasoning goes from specific examples to a general statement, the
>   argument is an example of inductive reasoning (although it may very well be faulty).
>   b) Here the premises are “All keyboards have the symbol @” and “I have a keyboard.” The
>   conclusion is “My keyboard has the symbol @.” This reasoning goes from general to
>   specific, so deductive reasoning was used.
