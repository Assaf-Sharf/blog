# 3.1 Statements and Quantifiers

Statements and Quantifiers

## Statement

A statement(or proposition) is a sentence that is true or false, but not both. Symbolic logic discuss only statements that involve `facts`. (e.g. The sun is a star &rarr; Fact)

## Not Statement

Sentences which cannot be statement.

- A command: sentence beginning with a verb.
  : E.g. Close the door.
- A question
  : E.g. Was it a tough choice?
- A opinion
  : E.g. Health informatics program is better than game designing.
- A paradox: one having seemingly contradictory qualities or phases.
  : E.g. I am a liar.

## Compound Statements

A compound statement may be formed by combining two or more statements. The statements making up the compound statement are called the `component statements`. Various connectives such as `and`, `or`, `not`, and `if...then`, can be used in forming compound statements.

- E.g.
  : The cat is fat `and` it is sleeping.
  : Yesterday, the student went to the park `or` the theatre.
  : A jaguar is `not` a car.
  : `If` it yawns, `then` it must be alive.

> Example 1: Deciding whether a statement is compound.
>
> Decide whether each statement is compound. If so, identify the connective.
>
> - a) Lord Byron wrote sonnets, and the poem exhibits iambic pentameter.
> - b) You can pay me now, or you can pay me later.
> - c) If it's on the Internet, then it must be true.
> - d) My pistol was made by Smith and Wesson.
>
> Solution:
>
> - a) This statement is compound, because it is made up of the component statements "Lord Byron wrote sonnets", and "the poem exhibits iambic pentameter." The connective is `and`.
> - b) The connective here is `or`. The statement is compound.
> - c) The connective here is `if...then`. The statement is compound.
> - d) Although the word `and` is used in this statement, it is not used as a `logical` connective. It is part of the name of the manufacturer. THe statement is not compound.

## Remark

A statement such as "Today is not Monday" is not formed of two components statements, for convenience it is considered compound, because its truth value is determined by the truth value of a statement such as "Today is Monday".

## Negations

The negation of a true statement is false, and the negation of a false statement is true.

> Example 1:
>
> - a)
>   : Statement: Ontario is a province in Canada. (True)
>   : Negation: Ontario is not a province. (False)
> - b)
>   : Statement: The moon is not a planet. (True)
>   : Negation: The moon is a planet. (False)

> Example 2: Forming negations
>
> Form the negation of each statement.
>
> - a) That city has a mayor.
> - b) The moon is not a planet.
>
> Solution:
>
> - a) To negate this statement, we introduce `not` into the sentence: "That city does not have a mayor."
> - b) The negation is "The moon is a planet."
