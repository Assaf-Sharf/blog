# 10.1 Counting by Systematic Listing

Counting by Systematic Listing

## One-Part Tasks

The results for simple, one-part tasks can often be listed easily. For the task of tossing a fair coin, the list is heads, tails, with two possible results. For the task of rolling a single fair die the list is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with six possibilities.

> Example 1:
>
> Consider a club N with four members: N = {Adam, Brian, Cindy, David} or in abbreviated form N = {A, B, C, D}. In how many ways can this group select a president?
>
> Solution:
>
> Club can select any of the four members as a president. So there are total 4 possible selections: A, B, C, and D.

> Example 2:
>
> Consider a club N with four members: N = {Mike, Adam, Ted, Helen} or in abbreviated form N = {M, A, T, H}. In how many ways can this group select a president?
>
> Solution:
>
> The task is to select one of the four members as president. There are four possible results: M, A, T, and H.

## Two-Part Tasks and Product Table

Two-part tasks can be listed by using a product table (it is not a database table that you normally come across in database courses). Product table can be created by listing first part results in rows and second part results in columns and then combine them to get the final list.

> Example 1:
>
> Determine the number of two-digit numbers that can be written using the digits from the set {2, 4, 6}.
>
> Solution:
>
> The task consists of two parts.
>
> 1. Choose a first digit.
> 2. Choose a second digit.
>
> The results for a two-part task can be pictured in a product table, as shown on the next slide.
>
> ![img](../../../assets/images/productTable.png)
>
> From the table we obtain the list of nine possible results: 22, 24, 26, 42, 44, 46, 62, 64, 66.

> Example 2:
>
> Determine the number of two-digit numbers that can be written using only the digits 1, 2, and 3.
>
> Solution:
>
> ![img](../../../assets/images/twoDigitTable.png)
>
> Thus the possible results. 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33; there are nine possibilities.

> Example 3:
>
> Consider a club N with four members: N = {Adam, Brian, Cindy, David} or in abbreviated form N = {A, B, C, D}.
>
> - a) In how many ways can this group select a president and secretary assuming all the members are eligible, and no one can hold both offices?
> - b) In how many ways can this club select a committee of two people?
>
> Solution:
>
> ![img](../../../assets/images/committeeTable.png)

> Example 4:
>
> Determine the number of different possible results when two ordinary dice are rolled.
>
> Solution:
>

## Tree Diagrams for Multiple-Part Tasks

A task that has more than two parts can be analyzed by a tree diagram.

> Example 1:
>
> Find the number of three-digit numbers that can be written using the digits from the set {2, 4, 6} assuming repeated digits are not allowed.
>
> Solution:
>
> ![img](../../../assets/images/repeatedDigitTable.png)

> Example 2:
>
> Pamela‚Äôs computer printer allows for optional settings with a panel of four on-off switches in a row. How many different settings can she select if no two adjacent switches can both be off?
>
> Solution:
>
> We denote `on` and `off` with 1 and 0, respectively. The number of possible settings is eight
>
> ![img](../../../assets/images/eightSettingTable.png)
>
> Notice that each time a switch is indicated as off (0), the next switch can only be on (1). This is to satisfy the restriction that no two adjacent switches can both be off.

## Other Systematic Listing Methods

There are additional systematic ways to produce complete listings of possible results besides product tables and tree diagrams. One of these ways is shown in the following example.

> Example 1:
>
> How many triangles (of any size) are in the figure below?
>
> ![img](../../../assets/images/triangle.png)
>
> Solution:
>
> One systematic approach is to label the points as shown, begin with A, and proceed in alphabetical order to write all 3-letter combinations (like ABC, ABD, ...), then cross out ones that are not triangles. There are 12 different triangles.

# 10.2 The Fundamental Counting Principle

The Fundamental Counting Principle

## Uniformity Criterion for Multiple-Part Tasks

A multiple-part task is said to satisfy the `uniformity criterion` if the number of choices for any particular part is the same no matter which choices were selected for the previous parts.

> Example 1:
>
> Construct a tree diagram showing all possible results when a fair coin is tossed four times, if no two consecutive tosses can both be heads.
>
> Solution:
>
> ![img](../../../assets/images/tossTreeDiagram.png)
>
> {htht, htth, httt, thth, thtt, ttht, ttth, tttt}

<br>

## Fundamental Counting Principle

When a task consists of `k` separate parts and satisfies the uniformity criterion, if the first part can be done in n<sub>1</sub> ways, the second part can be done in n<sub>2</sub> ways, and so on through the `k` th part, which can be done in n<sub>k</sub> ways, then the total number of ways to complete the task is given by the product n<sub>1</sub> \* n<sub>2</sub> \* n<sub>3</sub> ... n<sub>k</sub>

> Example 1:
>
> How many two-digit numbers can be made from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}?
>
> Solution:
>
> - First digit can be selected 5 ways (first digit cannot be 0).
> - Second digit can be selected 6 ways.
> - Total number of two-digit numbers = 5 x 6 = 30.

> Example 2:
>
> How many two-digit numbers that do not contain repeated digits can be made from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}?
>
> Solution:
>
> - First digit can be selected 5 ways (first digit cannot be 0).
> - Second digit can be selected 5 ways.
> - Total number of two-digit numbers = 5 x 5 = 25.

> Example 3:
>
> How many ways can you select two letters followed by three digits for an ID?
>
> Solution:
>
> - First letter can be selected 26 ways.
> - Second letter can be selected 26 ways.
> - First digit can be selected 10 ways.
> - Second digit can be selected 10 ways.
> - Third digit can be selected 10 ways.
> - Total number of ID = 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 X 10 = 676000.

> Example 4:
>
> In some states, auto license plates have contained three letters followed by three digits. How many such licenses are possible?
>
> Solution:
>
> The basic task is to design a license plate with three letters followed by three digits. There are six component parts to this task. There are no restrictions on letters or digits, so the fundamental counting principle gives 26 x 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 26<sup>3</sup> x 10<sup>3</sup> = 17,576,000 possible licenses. In practice, a few of the possible sequences of letters are considered undesirable and are not used.

## Factorials

For any counting number n, the product of all counting numbers from n down through 1 is called n factorial and is denoted n!

- n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... x 1
- Note: 0! = 1 and 1! = 1
