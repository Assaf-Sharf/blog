## Algebraic Expression

An algebraic expression involves only the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (except by 0), or raising to powers or taking roots on any collection of variables and numbers.

### <u>Algebraic expressions examples:</u>

- 4x - 7
- $$\sqrt{m} + 3
- {xy<sup>3</sup>z} \over {k}

<br>

## Equation

An equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. A linear equation in one variable involves only real numbers and one variable.

### <u>Linear equations examples:</u>

- 4x - 7 = 8
- 5k + 3 = k + 1
