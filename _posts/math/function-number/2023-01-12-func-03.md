## Operations of Real Numbers

### 1. Definition of Subtraction

- The result of subtracting two numbers is their difference.
- "The difference of A and B" is interpreted as "A-B"
- For all real numbers A and B, A-B = A+(-B) &rarr; Change the sign of the subtrahend and Add.
- In A-B, A is the **minuend**, and B is the **subtrahend**.
- [What is Subtrahend?](https://www.splashlearn.com/math-vocabulary/subtraction/subtrahend)

### 2. Multiplying Real Numbers

- The result of multiplying two numbers is their product.
- The two numbers being multiplied are factors.

> **Like Signs**:
>
> - Multiply two numbers with the same sign by multiplying their
>   absolute values to find the absolute value of the product.
> - The product is positive.
>
> **Unlike Signs**:
>
> - Multiply two numbers with different signs by multiplying their
>   absolute values to find the absolute value of the product.
> - The product is negative.

> **Sign Rules for Multiplication**
>
> 1. (+)\*(+) = +
> 2. (-)\*(-) = +
> 3. (+)\*(-) = -
> 4. (-)\*(+) = -

### 3. Dividing Real Numbers

- The result of dividing two numbers is their quotient.
- "The quotient of A and B" is interpreted as "A/B"
- In the quotient A/B, where B≠0, A is the **dividend (or numerator)**, and B is the **divisor (or denominator)**.

> **Like Signs**:
>
> - Divide two numbers with the same sign by dividing their absolute
>   values to find the absolute value of the quotient.
> - The quotient is positive.
>
> **Unlike Signs**:
>
> - Divide two numbers with different signs by dividing their absolute
>   values to find the absolute value of the quotient.
> - The quotient is negative.

> **Sign Rules for Division**
>
> 1. (+)/(+) = +
> 2. (-)/(-) = +
> 3. (+)/(-) = -
> 4. (-)/(+) = -

> **Division Involving Zero**
>
> 1. A/0 is undefined for all A
> 2. 0/A = 0 for all nonzero A
