## Ratio, Proportion, and Variation

- Solving Proportions
- Direct Variation

## Writing Ratios

- Ratios provide a way of comparing two numbers or quantities.
- Examples: A baseball player‚Äôs batting average is a ratio. The slope, or pitch of a roof on a building may be expressed as a ratio.

### <u>Ratio</u>

A ratio is a quotient of two quantities. The ratio of the number a to the number b is written

| The ratio | of two              | number |
| :-------- | :------------------ | :----- |
| a to b    | $$ {a} \over {b} $$ | a:b    |

When ratios are used in comparing units of measure, the units should be the same.

### <u>Example: Writing Ratios</u>

Write a ratio for the word phrase: 8 hours to 2 days.

<u>Solution</u>

$$ {8hr} \over {2days} $$ =
$$ {8hr} \over {48hr} $$ =
$$ {8} \over {48} $$ =
$$ {1} \over {6} $$

<br>

## Proportion

A proportion is a statement that says that two ratios are equal.

Example: $$ {1} \over {2} $$ = $$ {3} \over {6} $$

In the proportion
$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$ (b ‚â† 0, d ‚â† 0),

a, b, c, and d are the terms of the proportion.

- The "a and d" terms are called the "extremes"
- the "b and c" terms are called the "means"

### <u>Cross Products</u>

If
$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$,
then the cross products "ad" and "bc" are "equal".

Also, if ad = bc, then
$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$ (as long as b ‚â† 0, d ‚â† 0).

The product of the extremes equals the product of the means.

### <u>Example: Solving Proportions</u>

Solve the proportion
$$ {4} \over {5} $$ =
$$ {22} \over {x} $$

| Solution                  |                              |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| 4 \* x = 22 \* 5          | Set the cross products equal |
| 4x = 110                  | Multiply                     |
| x = $$ {110} \over {4} $$ | Divide by 4                  |

The result is
$$ {55} \over {2} $$

<br>

## Direct Variation

y varies directly as x, or y is directly proportional to x, if there exists a nonzero constant k such that

y = kx, or equivalently,
$$ {y} \over {x} $$
= k

The constant k is a numerical value called the constant of variation.
