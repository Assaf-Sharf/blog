## Writing Ratios

- Ratios provide a way of comparing two numbers or quantities.
- Examples: A baseball player‚Äôs batting average is a ratio. The slope, or pitch of a roof on a building may be expressed as a ratio.

### <u>Ratio</u>

A ratio is a quotient of two quantities. The ratio of the number a to the number b is written

> - a to b
> - $$ {a} \over {b} $$
> - a:b

When ratios are used in comparing units of measure, the units should be the same.

### <u>Example 1: Writing Ratios</u>

Write a ratio for the word phrase: 8 hours to 2 days.

<u>Solution</u>

$$ {8hr} \over {2days} $$ =
$$ {8hr} \over {48hr} $$ =
$$ {8} \over {48} $$ =
$$ {1} \over {6} $$
