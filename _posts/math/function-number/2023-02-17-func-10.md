## Types of Linear Equations

| Type          | Number of Solutions                       | Final Line When Solving         |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Conditional   | One                                       | x = number                      |
| Identity      | Infinite; solution set {all real numbers} | True statement such as 0 = 0.   |
| Contradiction | None; solution set ‚àÖ                      | False statement, such as 0 = 1. |

<br>

## Example 1: Identity

Solve 3k + 4 ‚Äì 2k = k + 4.

| Solution              |                    |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- |
| k + 4 = k + 4         | Combine like terms |
| k - k + 4 = k - k + 4 | Subtract k         |
| 4 = 4                 | Combine like terms |

Because the result is **true**, the solution set is **{all real numbers}** &rarr; k can be any real number and the original equation is an **identity**.

<br>

## Example 2: Contradiction

Solve 3k + 4 ‚Äì 2k = k.

| Solution          |                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------- |
| k + 4 = k         | Combine like terms |
| k - k + 4 = k - k | Subtract k         |
| 4 = 0             | Combine like terms |

Because the result is **false**, the equation has no solution. The solution set is **‚àÖ**, so the original equation is a **contradiction**.

## Literal Equations and Formulas

- An equation involving variables (or letters), such as "y = mx + b" is called a literal equation.
- Formulas are literal equations in which more than one letter is used to express a relationship.
- It may be necessary to solve for one of the variables in a formula. This process is called solving for a specified variable.

### <u>Solving for a Specified Variable</u>

- Step 1
  : Transform the equation so that all terms containing the specified variable are on one side of the equation and all terms without the variable are on the other side.
- Step 2
  : If necessary, use the distributive property to combine the terms with the specified variable.
- Step 3
  : Divide both sides by the factor that is multiplied by the specified variable.

### <u>Example: Solving for a Specified Variable</u>

Solve the formula **P = 2L + 2W** for L.

| Solution                                    |                    |
| :------------------------------------------ | :----------------- |
| P ‚Äì 2W = 2L + 2W ‚Äì 2W                       | Subtract 2W        |
| P ‚Äì 2W = 2L                                 | Combine like terms |
| $${P ‚Äì 2W} \over {2}$$ = $${2L} \over {2}$$ | Divide by 2        |

The result is

- $$ {P ‚Äì 2W} \over {2} $$ = L
- $$ {P} \over {2} $$ - W = L

<br>

## Models

A mathematical model is an equation (or inequality) that describes the relationship between two quantities. A linear model is a linear equation.

### <u>Example: Models - Temperature Conversion</u>

The relationship between degrees Celsius (C) and degrees Fahrenheit (F) is **modeled by the linear equation** "F = 1.8C + 32."

What Celsius degree corresponds to a Fahrenheit reading of 50¬∞F?

| Solution          |                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------- |
| k + 4 = k         | Combine like terms |
| k - k + 4 = k - k | Subtract k         |
| 4 = 0             | Combine like terms |
