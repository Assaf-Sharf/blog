# Linear Growth and Arithmetic Sequence

Suppose that you earn $30 each day. If you start out with $100 in your savings, and you add the $30 to your savings every evening, how much will you have saved after 11 days?

| Days | Amount($) | Analysis      |
| :--- | :-------- | :------------ |
| 0    | 100       | 100 + 1 \* 30 |
| 1    | 130       | 100 + 2 \* 30 |
| 2    | 160       | 100 + 3 \* 30 |

There is a pattern in the growth of the amount. At the end of the 11th day, you will have:

100 + 11 x 30 = $430 saved.

This additive growth is called linear growth.

## 1. Arithmetic Sequence

In an arithmetic sequence, the number obtained by subtracting any two consecutive terms is a constant. This constant "d" is called the "common difference" where "d = t<sub>n+1</sub> - t<sub>n</sub>"; subscript indicates order of term in the sequence.

Ex) 4, 9, 14, 19 ... &rarr; d = 9 - 4 = 5

## Example: 1. Arithmetic Sequence

1. State the common difference of arithmetic sequence: a) 25, 21, 17, ...

> d = t<sub>n+1</sub> - t<sub>n</sub>

| Answer           |
| :--------------- |
| d = 21 -‚ÄÑ25 = -4 |

<br>

## 1 - a. The general term of the arithmetic sequence

a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ‚Ä¶ is "t<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d," n is order of term in the sequence.

Ex) Determine the 30th term of the arithmetic sequence 4, 7, 10, ...

> d = t<sub>n+1</sub> - t<sub>n</sub>
>
> t<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d

| Answer                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------ |
| d = 7 -‚ÄÑ4 = 3                                     |
| t<sub>30</sub> = 4 + (30 - 1)(3) = 4 + 29(3) = 91 |

## Example: 1 - a. The general term of the arithmetic sequence

Determine the indicated term of the arithmetic sequence: 23, 34, 45, ... 10th term.

| Answer                                                |
| :---------------------------------------------------- |
| d = 34 -‚ÄÑ23 = 11                                      |
| t<sub>10</sub> = 23 + (10 - 1)(11) = 23 + 9(11) = 122 |

<br>

## 1 - b. The Sum of an Arithmetic Series

For the general arithmetic series "a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + ... + t<sub>n</sub>," the sum of the first n terms is:

- S<sub>n</sub> =
  $$ {n} \over {2} $$
  (a + t<sub>n</sub>)
