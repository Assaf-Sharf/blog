## 1. Basic Terminology

- A term, or monomial, is defined to be a number, a variable, or a product of numbers and variables.
  : Examples: 7, and 8r
- A polynomial is a term, or a finite sum or difference of terms, with only nonnegative integer exponents permitted on the variables. If the terms of a polynomial contain only the variable x, then the polynomial is called a polynomial in x. (Polynomials in other variables are defined similarly.)
  : Example: 3x<sup>5</sup> + 4x ‚Äì 1
- The expression 9x<sup>2</sup> - 4x -
  $$ {6} \over {x} $$
  is not a polynomial because of the presence of -
  $$ {6} \over {x} $$
  &rarr; The terms of a polynomial cannot have variables in a denominator.
- The greatest exponent in a polynomial in one variable is the degree of the polynomial. A non-zero constant is said to have degree 0. (The polynomial 0 has no degree.)
  : Examples: 3x<sup>6</sup> - 5x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 3 is a polynomial of degree 6 .
- A term containing more than one variable has degree equal to the sum of all the exponents appearing on the variables in the term.
  : Example: 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>z + 3x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup>z has degree 6.
- A polynomial containing exactly three terms is called a trinomial and one containing exactly two terms is a binomial.

  | Polynomial                                       | Degree | Type      |
  | :----------------------------------------------- | :----- | :-------- |
  | 9x<sup>4</sup> - 4x<sup>3</sup> + 8x<sup>2</sup> | 4      | Trinomial |
  | 29x<sup>3</sup> + 8x<sup>2</sup>                 | 3      | Binomial  |
  | -10x                                             | 1      | Monomial  |
