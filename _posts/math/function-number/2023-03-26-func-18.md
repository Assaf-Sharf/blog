## Terminology

If the value of the variable y depends on the value of the variable x, the y is the dependent variable and x the independent variable.

## 1-1. Relations

A relation is a set of ordered pairs.

For example, the sets

- F = {(1, 2), (‚Äì1, 5), (4, 3)}
- G = {(1, 5), (9, 0), (9, 8)}

&rarr; Both F and G are relations!

<br>

## 1-2. Functions

A function is a relation in which for each value of the first component of the ordered pairs there is exactly one value of the second component.

Of the two sets,

- F = {(1, 2), (‚Äì1, 5), (4, 3), (2, 5)}
- G = {(1, 5), (9, 0), (9, 8)}

&rarr; Only F is a function and G is a just relation!

- Because only F is a function because each x value has only one y value. G is a relation since x = 9 is having more than one y value; y = 0 and 8.
- Note for function F, two x = -1 and 2 have y = 5. So, in a Function multiple x can have same y, but a single x can‚Äôt have multiple y.

### <u>Example: Determining Independent and Dependent Variables</u>

Determine the independent and dependent variables for the following. The procedure by which someone uses a calculator that finds square roots; y = sqrt x

<u>Solution</u>

- The independent variable (input) is a nonnegative real number; x.
- The dependent variable (output) is the positive principal square root; y.
- y value DEPENDS on our selected value for x.
- For example (81, 9) belongs to this function.

<br>

## 2. Domain and Range

In a relation, the set of all values of the independent variable (x) is the domain.

The set of all values of the dependent variable (y) is the range.

### <u>Example: Determining Domain and Range</u>

Give the domain and range of y =
$$ \sqrt {x} $$
