## Terminology

If the value of the variable y depends on the value of the variable x, the y is the dependent variable and x the independent variable.

<br>

## 1-1. Relations

A relation is a set of ordered pairs.

For example, the sets

- F = {(1, 2), (‚Äì1, 5), (4, 3)}
- G = {(1, 5), (9, 0), (9, 8)}

&rarr; Both F and G are relations!

<br>

## 1-2. Functions

A function is a relation in which for each value of the first component of the ordered pairs there is exactly one value of the second component.

Of the two sets,

- F = {(1, 2), (‚Äì1, 5), (4, 3), (2, 5)}
- G = {(1, 5), (9, 0), (9, 8)}

&rarr; Only F is a function and G is a just relation!

- Because only F is a function because each x value has only one y value. G is a relation since x = 9 is having more than one y value; y = 0 and 8.
- Note for function F, two x = -1 and 2 have y = 5. So, in a Function multiple x can have same y, but a single x can‚Äôt have multiple y.

### <u>Example: Determining Independent and Dependent Variables</u>

Determine the independent and dependent variables for the following. The procedure by which someone uses a calculator that finds square roots; y =
$$ \sqrt {x} $$

<u>Solution</u>

- The independent variable (input) is a nonnegative real number; x.
- The dependent variable (output) is the positive principal square root; y.
- y value DEPENDS on our selected value for x.
- For example (81, 9) belongs to this function.

<br>

## 2. Domain and Range

In a relation, the set of all values of the independent variable (x) is the domain.

The set of all values of the dependent variable (y) is the range.

### <u>Example: Determining Domain and Range</u>

Give the domain and range of y =
$$ \sqrt {x} $$

<u>Solution</u>

- The domain (x) is restricted to the nonnegative numbers: [0, ‚àû)
- The range (y) also is only the principal positive root: [0, ‚àû)

<br>

## 3. Graphs of Relations

- The graph of a relation is the graph of its ordered pairs.
- The graph gives a picture of the relation, which can be used to determine its domain and range.

### <u>Example: Determining Domain and Range 1</u>

![DeterminingDomainRange1](../../../assets/images/DeterminingDomainRange1.png)

### <u>Example: Determining Domain and Range 2</u>

![DeterminingDomainRange2](../../../assets/images/DeterminingDomainRange2.png)

> Agreement on Domain
>
> The domain of a relation is assumed to be all real numbers that produce real numbers when substituted for the independent variable.

<br>

## 4. Graphs of Functions

- In a function, each value of x leads to only one value of y, so any vertical line drawn through the graph of a function must intersect the graph in at most one point.
- This is called the vertical line test for a function.
- If a vertical line intersects the graph of at more than one point, then it is for a relation not for a function.

### <u>Example: Vertical Line Test</u>

| Vertical Line Test                                                 |                                                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![VerticalLineTest1](../../../assets/images/VerticalLineTest1.png) | Not a function &rarr; The same x-value corresponds to multiple y-values |
| ![VerticalLineTest2](../../../assets/images/VerticalLineTest2.png) | Function &rarr; each x-value corresponds to only one y-value            |

### <u>Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 1</u>

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y =
$$ \sqrt {x + 1} $$

Note that for square root function, Domain of x values must have what is under the root ‚â• 0
{: .notice--info}

<u>Solution</u>

- Yes, it is a function
- To find the domain note that x + 1 >= 0.
- The domain is [-1, ‚àû) and The range is [0, ‚àû)

### <u>Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 2</u>

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y<sup>2</sup> = x

<u>Solution</u>

- No, it is not a function
- (16, 4) and (16, -4) both work. (In a Function, multiple x can have same y, but a single x can‚Äôt have multiple y.)
- The domain is [0, ‚àû) and The range is (-‚àû, ‚àû)

### <u>Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 3</u>

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y <= 2x

<u>Solution</u>

- No, it is not a function
- For example, if x = 1, then any y value less than or equal to 2 would satisfy the inequality, so there are infinitely many possible y values for x = 1.
- The domain and range are (-‚àû, ‚àû)

### <u>Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 3</u>

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y =
$$ {3} \over {x - 2} $$

Note that for fractional function, Domain of x values must have "denominator ‚â† 0"
{: .notice--info}

<u>Solution</u>

- Yes, it is a function
- The domain is (-‚àû, 2] U [2, ‚àû), since we avoid 0 in the denominator.
- The range is (-‚àû, 0] U [0, ‚àû)
