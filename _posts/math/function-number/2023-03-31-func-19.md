# 1. Exponential Functions and Applications

An exponential function with base b, where b > 0 and b != 1, is a function of the form f(x) = b<sup>x</sup>, where x is any real number.

## Example: Graph of Exponential Function (b > 1)

## Example: Graph of Exponential Function (0 < b < 1)

# 1 - A. Graph of f(x) = b<sup>x</sup>

1. The graph always will contain the point (0, 1).
2. When b > 1, the graph will rise from left to right.
   When 0 < b < 1, the graph will fall from left to
   right.
3. The x-axis is the horizontal asymptote.
4. The domain is (-‚àû, ‚àû) and the range is (0, ‚àû).

# 1 - C. Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that a principal of P dollars is invested at an annual interest rate r (in percent, expressed as a decimal), compounded n times per year. Then the amount A accumulated after t years is given by the formula

A = P(1 +
$$ {r} \over {n} $$
)<sup>nt</sup>

## Example: Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that $2000 dollars is invested at an annual rate of 8%, compounded quarterly. Find the total amount in the account after 6 years if no withdrawals are made.

| Solution                                    |
| :------------------------------------------ |
| A = P(1 + $$ {r} \over {n} $$)<sup>nt</sup> |

| A = 2000(1 +
$$ {0.08} \over {4} $$
)<sup>4(6)</sup> |
| A = 2000(1.02)<sup>24</sup> ‚âà 2000(1.60844) = 3216.88 |

There would be $3216.88 in the account at the end of six years.

# 1 - D. Continuous Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that a principal of P dollars is invested at an annual interest rate r (in percent, expressed as a decimal), compounded continuously. Then the amount A accumulated after t years is given by the formula

A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>.

## Example: Continuous Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that $2000 dollars is invested at an annual rate of 8%, compounded continuously. Find the total amount in the account after 6 years if no withdrawals are made.

A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>

A = 2000e<sup>0.08(6)</sup>

A = 2000e<sup>0.48</sup> ‚âà 2000(1.61607) = 3232.14

There would be $3232.14 in the account at the end of six years.

# 1 - E. Doubling Time Formula

Time needed to double an initial amount as an exponential function: A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>

- A: is present amount
- P: is future amount after t years
- r: is annual compounding rate

## Example: Doubling Time

Suppose that a certain amount P is invested at an annual rate of 5% compounded continuously. How long will it take for the amount to double (doubling time)?

A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>

2P = Pe<sup>0.05t</sup>
