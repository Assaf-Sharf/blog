# Graphs of "y = a sin(bx + c)" and "y = a cos(bx + c)"

1. Amplitude
   : = y<sub>max</sub> = |a|
   : = y<sub>min</sub> = -|a|
2. Period &rarr; P =
   $$ {2œÄ} \over {b} $$
   : - P/4 = step on x-axis (five x values needed on x-axis to have graph for one period)
3. Shift or Displacement =
   $$ {-c} \over {b} $$
   : = Starting x value (c is called phase angle)

Note: You must have your Calculator on Radians

# Example

## Example 1: Sketching graph of "y = a sin(bx + c)"

Sketch the graph y = 2 sin(3x - œÄ).

| Solution |                                                                         |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a = 2    | Amplitude = y<sub>max</sub> = \|a\| = 2, y<sub>min</sub> = -\|a\| = -2  |
| b = 3    | Period(cycle) = P = 2œÄ/b = 2œÄ/3 (P/4) = 2œÄ/12 = œÄ/6 = Step on x-axis    |
| c = -œÄ   | Shift(Displacement) = -c/b = -(-œÄ)/3 = œÄ/3 = Starting x value on x-axis |
