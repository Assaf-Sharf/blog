A smile on you makes me forget to breathe

yet it is as rich as the first breath taken, after being drowned.

The solar system depicted in your eyes

my favorite flavor of summer, radiating in your freckles

your full lips still, talking to me in the language of love.

&nbsp;  

You smile so strong I don't just see it, I feel it.

On me,

for me,

because of me?

&nbsp;  

I wish I could say your smile was contagious

but when it shines on me

I enter a heavy daze, blinded by its gaze.

It puts me in a trance

where I could happily be bamboozled

For nothing you take from me, could be as priceless as what I have just received from you.
