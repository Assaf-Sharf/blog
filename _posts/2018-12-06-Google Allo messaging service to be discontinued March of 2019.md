<p><p>Google has announced that it is discontinuing Allo, one of its several messaging services for smart devices, in March of 2019.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.google/products/messages/latest-messages-allo-duo-and-hangouts/" rel="nofollow">an official Google blog post</a>, Vice President of Consumer Communications Products Matt Klainer detailed the search giant's plans for its messaging service portfolio. The company has decided to halt all development on <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-allo/'><img alt='Small Google Allo icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-allo_94784.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Allo</a> and bring all of its competitive features, such as desktop support, GIFs, and Smart Replies, into the default <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/messenger/'><img alt='Small Android Messages icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/messenger_101243.webp?format=png&width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android Messages</a> app.</p>
<p>Until Allo's shutdown in March of 2019, users can download archives of all of their chats and media by following <a href="https://support.google.com/allo/answer/7365005#download" rel="nofollow">the instructions that Google has published on its Allo support page</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post also reminded readers that one of Google's voice and video chat apps, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-duo/'><img alt='Small Google Duo icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-duo_91692.webp?format=png&width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Duo</a>, now supports more hardware form factors and has the ability to leave video messages. This, coupled with <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-hangouts/'><img alt='Small Hangouts icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-hangouts_83729.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Hangouts</a> now planned to be split into Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet, shows that Google is making wholesale changes to its message and real-time communication software and services.</p>
