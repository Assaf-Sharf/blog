<p><p>Earlier today, Google announced and released an extension for its Chrome web browser named Privacy Checkup. The extension is designed to alert users of any passwords used that match with those identified as part of any known data breach, and will assist users in changing that password into one that has not been compromised.</p>
<p>As detailed in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/02/protect-your-accounts-from-data.html" rel="nofollow">a post on the company's online security blog</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/password-checkup/'><img alt='Small Password Checkup icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/password-checkup_139301.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Password Checkup</a> was developed with three key principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alerts should provide concise and accurate security advice</li>
<li>Neither Google nor any other party can see the personal information entered</li>
<li>Password Checkup will only generate an alert when both your current username and password appear in a breach</li>
</ol>
<p>Password Checkup parses this information without any of it being revealed to Google or at risk of being hijacked by attackers by utilizing &quot;multiple rounds of hashing, k-anonymity, private information retrieval, and a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinding_(cryptography)" rel="nofollow">blinding</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Password Checkup is now available for <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-chrome/'><img alt='Small Google Chrome icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-chrome_96565.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Chrome</a> via the <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/chrome-web-store/'><img alt='Small Chrome Web Store icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/chrome-web-store_97603.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Chrome Web Store</a>.</p>
