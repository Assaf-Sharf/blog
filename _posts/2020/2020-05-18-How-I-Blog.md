# How I Blog..!!

## Platform

After a long struggle decided to host my site in GitHub because it's free and reliable.

### GitHub pages
 
[Git Pages](https://pages.github.com/) it's a wonderful platform to start your blog\website at zero price. I recommend every beginner should try this to start their blog. It hosts your site on GitHub where you have source control for your code\site.

### Theme and Framework

[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/) build on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) one of the popular static site generator.
 
## Configuration changes I made
 
_Will update them here_

## Editor I use

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my IDE to write code and blog posts.

## Comments

I haven't finalized on this, earlier I thought to go with Staticman, Now I want to do more research on it.

### Staticman

Later a long struggle for I came to know that Staticman is not longer providing an API to host your comments, rather you should deploy your instance of Staticman to host your comments. Here is a wonderful [article](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html) by [Tavius down](https://travisdowns.github.io/) to deploy and integrate it with your blog.
