<p><p>The 500px photo sharing site was breached by hackers on or near July 5, 2018, according to <a href="https://support.500px.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017752493-Security-Issue-February-2019-FAQ" rel="nofollow">a Q&amp;A posted on the site's support page</a>. 500px's engineering team became aware of this breach seven months later on February 8, 2019. All users of the site prior to this July 5, 2018 breach were impacted.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A post states that the following information for each of the 14.8 million impacted users was impacted:<br />
• Your first and last name as entered on 500px<br />
• Your 500px username<br />
• The email address associated with your 500px login<br />
• A hash of your password, which was hashed using a one-way cryptographic algorithm<br />
• Your birth date, if provided<br />
• Your city, state/province, country, if provided<br />
• Your gender, if provided</p>

The Q&amp;A noted that the password reset instructions email may take some time to be sent to your inbox due to the heavy traffic requesting password reset emails.</p>
<p>In order to ensure this event does not happen in the future, 500px is &quot;partnering with leading experts in cyber security to further secure our website, mobile apps, internal systems, and security processes,&quot; as well as upgrading their network infrastructure and internal software development process.</p>
