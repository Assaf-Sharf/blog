<p><p>The $7.5 billion USD purchase of GitHub has now been completed.</p>
<p><a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/6/microsoft-is-acquiring-github-for-7-5-billion-usd" rel="nofollow">As announced back in June</a>, GitHub is being acquired by Microsoft, and that acquisition has been formally completed. Nat Friedman is officially taking over as Chief Executive Officer at GitHub on Monday, October 29th, and has written about the completion of the acquisition <a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/" rel="nofollow">on the official GitHub blog</a>.</p>
<p>In Friedman's blog post, he reiterates his two key points that were originally shared back in June with the acquisition announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub will operate independently as a community, platform, and business.</li>
<li>GitHub will retain its product philosophy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Friedman shared three new objectives that will be used to guide <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/github/'><img alt='Small GitHub icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/github_96714.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />GitHub</a>'s future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring GitHub is the best place to run productive communities and teams</li>
<li>Making GitHub accessible to more developers around the world</li>
<li>Reliability, security, and performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these objectives, focus will be placed on GitHub's mobile layout, search, notifications, and issue/project layout.</p>
