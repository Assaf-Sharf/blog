Trying to emulate the look and feel of [watercolor on the iPad]({{ site.url }}/paperfaces/) has inspired me to revisit painting traditionally. I've gone mini in an effort to fit some painting in amongst family and work obligations. 

My plan was to complete a miniature 1.5\" painting a day, but the challenge of painting so small is eating up way too much time. Instead I'm going to keep things casual and let images happen as they happen.
