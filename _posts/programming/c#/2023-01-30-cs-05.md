## What is a Program?

A program will be the statements that you write in Visual Studio.

These statement might include the following:

Comments:

- Notes that the developer would make for anyone reading the code.
- Should have your name and the date and purpose of your code.
- Must include the problem specification as well.

Statements:

- Using statement.
- Declaration statement.
- Expression statements.
- Other kinds of statements e.g. if, switch do-while, ...

## How are statements processed?

### <u>For most modern languages, executions (processing) starts in a special spot often referred to as the entry point. In C# it is the main method.</u>

### <u>The first statement in the main method is processed, and then the next, and then the next until the last one and then the program ends.</u>

### <u>This order of processing is natural and logical.</u>

### <u>It is natural because this is how everything in the world works.</u>

### <u>Logical because all the statement are guaranteed to be processed.</u>

- You are able to predict the output of a block of code.
- This allows you to read code.
