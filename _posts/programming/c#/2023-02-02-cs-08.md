## C# Switch

Use the "switch" statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

> <u>Syntax</u>
>
> ```
> switch(expression)
> {
>   case x:
>     // code block
>     break;
>   case y:
>     // code block
>     break;
>   default:
>     // code block
>     break;
> }
> ```

This is how it works:

- The "switch" expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each "case".
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

```
int day = 4;

switch (day)
{
  case 1:
    Console.WriteLine("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    Console.WriteLine("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    Console.WriteLine("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    Console.WriteLine("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    Console.WriteLine("Sunday");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
```

<br>

## The break Keyword

When C# reaches a "break" keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.

## The default Keyword

The "default" keyword is optional and specifies some code to run if there is no case match:

```
int day = 4;
switch (day)
{
  case 6:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Saturday.");
    break;
  case 7:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Sunday.");
    break;
  default:
    Console.WriteLine("Looking forward to the Weekend.");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Looking forward to the Weekend."
```
