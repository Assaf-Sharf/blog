# Instructions

For each of the problems below, identify the output(s) and the inputs. Generate a detailed algorithm (you must prompt for and accept inputs and then display the output on the console) and create a two-column IPO chart with the required algorithm. Your C# statements must align with the matching IPO chart information. Your identifiers must be description and the type must be appropriate to the data that you will be working with. You should desk check your algorithm

## Checklist:

- Did you copy the problem specification to your answer page?
- Do you have a sample calculation with actual number?
- Do you have 3 columns?
- Are you using identifiers without spaces?
- Are you using a fixed-face font?
- Does the IPO statement align with the appropriate C# statement? (You may add empty lines, reduce the size of the fonts and/or adjust the width of the columns)

## Question 1

After surveying a number of new-home electrical installations, Kelly Builder‚Äôs Inc. has worked out what the length of wire a typical house would require. Write a program that will prompt the user for the average length required for a home and the number of houses to wire. The program will then calculate and display the total length of wire required for the specified number of houses.
