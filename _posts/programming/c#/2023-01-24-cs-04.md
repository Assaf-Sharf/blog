## C#

- C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
- C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.

### <u>What is C#?</u>

- An object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
- C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.
- The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 11, was released in November 2022.

### <u>Why use C#?</u>

- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.
- It is easy to learn and simple to use.
- It has a huge community support.
- C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa

### <u>C# IDE</u>

- The easiest way to get started with C#, is to use an IDE.
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit and compile code. &rarr; Visual Studio
- Applications written in C# use the .NET Framework, so it makes sense to use Visual Studio, as the program, the framework, and the language, are all created by Microsoft.

<br>

## C# Syntax

Example

```
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation of Example

- Line 1: "using System" means that we can use classes from the "System" namespace.
- Line 2: A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.
- Line 3: "namespace" is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.
- Line 4: The curly braces "{}" marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
- Line 5: "class" is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class "Program."
- Line 7: Another thing that always appear in a C# program, is the "Main" method. Any code inside its curly brackets "{}" will be executed. You don't have to understand the keywords before and after Main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.
- Line 9: "Console" is a class of the "System" namespace, which has a "WriteLine()" method that is used to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World!".

> - If you omit the "using System" line, you would have to write "System.Console.WriteLine()" to print/output text.
> - Every C# statement ends with a semicolon ;.
> - C# is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
> - Unlike Java, the name of the C# file does not have to match the class name, but they often do (for better organization). When saving the file, save it using a proper name and add ".cs" to the end of the filename.

<br>

## C# Output

To output values or print text in C#, Use the "WriteLine()" method.

```
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

```
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");
```

```
Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);
```

### <u>The Write Method</u>

- Similar to "WriteLine()" method.
- The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output.

> <u>Ex of WriteLine Method</u>
>
> ```
> Console.WriteLine("Hello World! ");
> Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C# ");
> Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");
> ```
>
> <u>Output</u>
>
> Hello World!
> <br> I am Learning C#
> <br> It is awesome!

> <u>Ex of Write Method</u>
>
> ```
> Console.Write("Hello World! ");
> Console.Write("I am Learning C# ");
> Console.Write("It is awesome!");
> ```
>
> <u>Output</u>
>
> Hello World! I am Learning C# It is awesome!

<br>

## C# Comments

Comments can be used to explain C# code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

### <u>Single-line Comments</u>

For short comments

```
// This is a comment
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

```
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");  // This is a comment
```

### <u>Multi-line Comments</u>

For longer comments

```
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

<br>

## C# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- int: stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- double: stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- char: stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- string: stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- bool: stores values with two states &rarr; true or false

### <u>Declaring (Creating) Variables</u>

> Syntax
>
> ```
> type variableName = value;
> ```
>
> Where type is a C# type (such as int or string), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

```
string name = "John";
Console.WriteLine(name);
```

```
int myNum = 15;
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
```

```
// You can declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
```

```
// If you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20; // myNum is now 20
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
```

> <u>Other Types</u>
>
> ```
> int myNum = 5;
> double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;
> char myLetter = 'D';
> bool myBool = true;
> string myText = "Hello";
> ```

### <u>C# Constants</u>

If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, you can add the const keyword in front of the variable type. &rarr; This will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only

```
const int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20; // Will occur error
```

> The const keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, so that others (or yourself) won't mess up your code. An example that is often referred to as a constant, is PI (3.14159...).
>
> Note: You cannot declare a constant variable without assigning the value. If you do, an error will occur: A const field requires a value to be provided.

### <u>C# Display Variables</u>

The "WriteLine()" method is often used to display variable values to the console window.

```
// To combine both text and a variable, use the "+" character
string name = "John";
Console.WriteLine("Hello " + name);
```

```
// You can also use the "+" character to add a variable to another variable
string firstName = "John ";
string lastName = "Doe";
string fullName = firstName + lastName;
Console.WriteLine(fullName);
```

```
// For numeric values, the "+" character works as a mathematical operator (notice that we use "int" (integer) variables here)
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
Console.WriteLine(x + y); // Print the value of x + y, that is "11"
```

### <u>C# Multiple Variables</u>

```
// To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);
```

```
// You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);
```

### <u>C# Identifiers</u>

- All C# variables must be identified with unique names.
- These unique names are called identifiers.
- Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
- It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code

```
// Good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;
```

> The general rules for naming variables are:
>
> - Names can contain letters, digits and the underscore character (\_)
> - Names must begin with a letter
> - Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
> - Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
> - Reserved words (like C# keywords, such as int or double) cannot be used as names

<br>

## C# Data Types

A variable in C# must be a specified data type

```
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;  // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
bool myBool = true;          // Boolean
string myText = "Hello";     // String
```

- A data type specifies the size and type of variable values.
- It is important to use the correct data type for the corresponding variable; to avoid errors, to save time and memory, but it will also make your code more maintainable and readable.
- We use binary computer &rarr; All information is stored as 1's and 0's
- E.g. Consider the bit sequence "0100 0001." What does it represent?
  - The number 65
  - The char A
  - The bool true
  - Double ?
  - String ?

### <u>Native OR Built-in Types</u>

- Simple type
  - int, char, double, and bool
- Native type
  - Simple types and Strings
- Custom type or user-defined types
- Conversion

### <u>The Most Common Data Types</u>

| Data   | Type Size             | Description                                                                       |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int    | 4 bytes               | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| long   | 8 bytes               | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float  | 4 bytes               | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits           |
| double | 8 bytes               | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits               |
| bool   | 1 bit                 | Stores true or false values                                                       |
| char   | 2 bytes               | Stores a single character/letter, surrounded by single quotes                     |
| string | 2 bytes per character | Stores a sequence of characters, surrounded by double quotes                      |

### <u>Numbers</u>

Number types are divided into two groups:

<u>Integer Types</u>

- stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals.
- Valid types are int and long.
- Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value.

> Int
>
> - This is a whole number and signed 32-bit integer.
> - The int data type can store whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 ("-2<sup>31<sup>" to "2<sup>31<sup> – 1").
> - In general, and in our tutorial, the int data type is the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.
> - Used to store numbers that you may perform the usual arithmetic operations.
>
> ```
> int myNum = 100000;
> Console.WriteLine(myNum);
> ```
>
> ```
> int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
> int a = 4;         //decimal literal
> int b = 0x12;      //hexadecimal literal
> int c = 0b1010;    //binary literal
> int d = 'A';       //char literal
>
> int b = 6;
> Console.WriteLine(a + b);
> ```

> Int to Other Types Conversions
>
> - To string (by concatenation with a string)
>
> ```
> 123 + "123";   //123123
> "" + 123;      // 123
> "nkp-" + 123;  //nkp-123
> ```
>
> - To double
>
> ```
> Convert.ToDouble(321);
> (double) 321; //this is call casting
> ```
>
> - To char
>
> ```
> Convert.ToChar(65);
> (char)65; //this is call casting
> ```
>
> - To bool
>   No conversion exist

> Long
>
> - The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
> - This is used when int is not large enough to store the value.
> - Note that you should end the value with an "L"
>
> ```
> long myNum = 15000000000L;
> Console.WriteLine(myNum);
> ```

<u>Floating Point Types</u>

- represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals.
- Valid types are float and double.
- You should use a floating point type whenever you need a number with a decimal, such as 9.99 or 3.14515.

> Float
>
> - Can store fractional numbers.
> - Note that you should end the value with an "F" for floats.
>
> ```
> // Float Example
> float myNum = 5.75F;
> Console.WriteLine(myNum);
> ```

> Double
>
> - Can store fractional numbers.
> - Note that you should end the value with an "D" for doubles.
> - A 64-bit floating point value.
> - Positive and negative zero.
> - Positive and negative infinity.
> - Not-a-Number value (NaN).
> - The finite set of nonzero values.
> - Used to store numbers that you may perform the usual arithmetic.
> - "-1.79x10<sup>308<sup>" to "+1.7x10<sup>308<sup>"
>
> ```
> // Double Example
> double myNum = 19.99D;
> Console.WriteLine(myNum);
> ```
>
> ```
> double weight = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
> double a = 3.14;
> double b = 3;      //integer literal
> double b = 'A';    //char literal
> double c = 5d;
> double c = 5.8E-6; //5.8 x 10<sup>-6<sup>
>
> Console.WriteLine(a + b);
> ```

> Double to Other Types Conversions
>
> - To string (by concatenation with a string)
>
> ```
> 1.23 + "13";     //1.2313
> "" + 12.3;       // 12.3
> "nkp-" + 1.3E5;  //nkp-1.3 x 10<sup>5<sup>
> ```
>
> - To int
>
> ```
> Convert.ToInt32(3.21);
> (int)3.21; //this is call casting

> ```
> Convert.ToChar(65.4);
> (char)65.4; //this is call casting
> ```
>
> - To bool
>   No conversion exist

> The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

> Decimal
>
> - A fixed precision number.
> - Uses 128 bit for storage.
> - "-7.9x10<sup>28<sup>" to "+7.9x10<sup>28<sup>"
>
> ```
> decimal a = 3.4m;   //hexadecimal literal
> decimal b = 3;      //integer literal
> decimal b = 3;      //even a char literal works
> decimal c = 3.14;   //double literal does not work
> ```
>
> - An int is accurate to 7 or 8 digits
> - A double is accurate to 15 digits
> - A decimal is accurate to 28 digits

> Scientific Numbers
>
> - A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10
>
> ```
> float f1 = 35e3F;
> double d1 = 12E4D;
> Console.WriteLine(f1); //Output: 35000
> Console.WriteLine(d1); //Output: 120000
> ```

### <u>Booleans</u>

- A boolean data type is declared with the bool keyword and can only take the values true or false.
- Boolean values are mostly used for conditional testing.
- Used to be comparisons.

```
bool isCSharpFun = true;
bool isFishTasty = false;
Console.WriteLine(isCSharpFun);   // Outputs True
Console.WriteLine(isFishTasty);   // Outputs False
```

```
bool isMarried = Convert.ToBoolean(Console.ReadLine());
bool a = true;
bool b = false;

Console.WriteLine(a + b); //ERROR
```

> Boolean to Other Types Conversions
>
> - To string (by concatenation with a string)
>
> ```
> true + "13";
> "" + false;
> ```
>
> - NO OTHER CONVERSION EXIST

### <u>Characters</u>

- This is actually a 16-bit numeric value.
- The char data type is used to store a single character.
- The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c' (A char literal is delimited by a pair of single quotes).
- Constants of the char type can be written as character literals, hexadecimal escape sequence, or Unicode representation.

```
char myGrade = 'B';
Console.WriteLine(myGrade);
```

```
char input = Convert.ToChar(Console.ReadLine());
char a = 'X';
char b = '\x0058’; //hexadecimal literal
char c = '\u0058’; //unicode

Console.WriteLine(a + b); //error
```

> Char to Other Types Conversions

> ```
> 'A' + "123"; //A123
> "" + 'b';    // b

> Convert.ToDouble('X');
> (double)'X'; //this is call casting
> ```
>
> - To int
>
> ```
> Convert.ToInt32('a');
> (int)'a'; //this is call casting
> ```
>
> - To bool
>   No conversion exist

### <u>Strings</u>

- This is a sequence of zero or more [unicode characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters)
- The string data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text).
- String values must be surrounded by double quotes, like "Hello" (Delimited by a pair of double quotes).
- Used to store text, part#, tel, ...
- Size is only limited by the amount of available system memory.

```
string greeting = "Hello World";
Console.WriteLine(greeting);
```

```
string name = Console.ReadLine();
string a = "h";
string b = "ello";
Console.WriteLine(a + b);

string c = @"\\icet1vm\1vm\npershad"; //Verbatim string useful for urls etc

string a = "\n";
```

### <u>Other Numeric Types</u>

- bytes, sbyte (8 bits)
- short, ushort (16 bits)
- uint (32 bits)
- long, ulong (64 bits)
- float (32 bits)
  <br> &rarr; "s-": Signed, "u-": Unsigned

<br> &rarr; The only difference between these and the ones that you will be using is the size and precision.
<br> &rarr; They following the same rules for mathematical operations.
<br> &rarr; Sometimes there might be over or under flows.

### <u>Formatting Numeric Values</u>

## Need to Remember

- Understanding data-type is crucial in mastering the semantics of a language.
- String is the most flexible data types.
- Bool is the least flexible data types.
- Although some conversions are automatic (implicit), in this course you MUST do an explicit cast.
- Casting a double to an int does not do any rounding &rarr; it simply discards the fractional part of the number.
