<p><p>Flickr, the photo sharing network and community that has offered 1 terabyte of storage for free, is moving to severely restrict this to 1,000 photos and videos total for free users.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/01/changing-flickr-free-accounts-1000-photos/" rel="nofollow">an announcement on the Flickr blog</a> by Andrew Stadlen, Flickr's Vice President of Product, it was further detailed that this 1,000 photo and video limit will be in effect starting from January 8, 2019. This gives free users two months to relocate the content hosted on the photo enthusiast-focused social network to a more secure storage solution. Alternatively, users can opt to maintain their library and have unlimited storage by subscribing to Flickr Pro.</p>
<p>Stadlen states that Yahoo's 2013 move to implement 1 terabyte of storage for every free user account on <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/flickr/'><img alt='Small Flickr icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/flickr_52956.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Flickr</a> changed the network's focus to shift towards the advertisers helping to foot the bill. <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/smugmug/'><img alt='Small SmugMug icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/smugmug_80467.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />SmugMug</a>, the company that <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/4/flickr-has-been-sold-by-yahoo-to-smugmug" rel="nofollow">purchased Flickr in April of this year</a>, believes that limiting the free storage like this will help shift Flickr's tone back to one focused around photography as an art form.</p>
