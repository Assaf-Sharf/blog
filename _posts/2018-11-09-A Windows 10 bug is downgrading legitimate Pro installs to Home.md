<p><p>Several Windows 10 Pro users woke up to a scare yesterday when they were falsely notified that they were running Windows 10 Pro with a Windows 10 Home license.</p>
<p>Microsoft has put out a statement via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-suddenly-deactivated/fe9a4ecf-2e2a-491d-a43e-b010c316d1c4?auth=1" rel="nofollow">a post on its official Microsoft Community site</a> that reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft has just released an Emerging issue announcement about current activation issue related to Pro edition recently. This happens in Japan, Korea, American and many other countries. I am very sorry to inform you that there is a temporary issue with Microsoft's activation server at the moment and some customers might experience this issue where Windows is displayed as not activated.<br />
Our engineers are working tirelessly to resolve this issue and it is expected to be corrected within one to two business days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of this writing, running the troubleshooter should resolve the issue.</p>
