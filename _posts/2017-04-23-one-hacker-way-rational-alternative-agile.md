I found the presentation very interesting and at some points inspiring. I could definitely relate to many of the points he is making but I have some disagreements also. I always like exaggeration as the means to prove an argument. It helps you point out a kind of a not very visible problem because it's buried or even hiding under so many layers but at the same time it has such a profound impact.

The core argument is that we talk too much about code instead of writing it. With this core argument, agile is challenged as an inefficient methodology because it's focused too much on talking about how to do something or how we did it instead of getting the job done. The "Hacker way" approach is used as comparison and you can read more about it on [Mark Zuckerberg’s Letter to Investors: ‘The Hacker Way’](https://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/). As part of the criticism, agile is accused about hypocrisy regarding the "self-organizing" aspect and the amount of irrelevant to code people it requires to function. 

I would like to state here that the words hack and hacker are misused by Zuckerberg and that this approach is not suitable for all types of businesses. As such, from this point any reference made to the *hacker way* is based on Meijer's presentation and not what Zuckerberg said or the model of Facebook.

Although the presentation targets agile and many points are valid, my main disaggreement is that agile is not the problem. Most arguments were valid for a very long time, they are still valid and probably will be. Let's take a look at this from the perspective of someone who grew up and worked in a country where people bust their asses for very little return.

In my country of origin Hellas (also referred to by most as Greece), we worked a sort of agile even before the first paper for agile was ever written. The main attribute was being flexible and quick to adjust. But our productivity was always killed by mismanagement and corruption on all levels. So agile or not, what Meijer talks about was always true and it has to purely do with with percentage distribution of doers and not. More importantly it has to do with impact distribution of the doers and not and their respected financial compensation. In simple terms, the best player often is paid the least and has the smallest potential for impact. It's not agile that is the core problem here, but the fact that the manner of how agile is embraced, it has allowed too much infusion of non useful elements. Let me offer two examples. 

No destributed scrum is the first thing everyone learns in a scrum training is to avoid splitting the team in different locations. "Subtle control" overrides the self organizing team by enforcing two or more locations for team members and that reduces efficiency. Another examplle would that team composition. A first thing that self organizing team would do, would be to chose, hire and fire it's members. But the "subtle control" doesn't really allow that. Instead, as part of a "higher" reasoning teams are forced into babysitting weaker elements by literally adding so much noise that the job can't get done. To be 100% clear, I'm not talking about training and educating juniors. They are the necessary challengers of your beliefs and if enabled the bearers of fresh ideas. Back to the point, this is because the people that own the "subtle control" have no idea about what it takes to get the job done and this is Meijer's point when he asked about who has commited code during the last week. And this is a reality independent of agile, so I disaggree with Meijer on his heavy critisicm of agile. Take [StaskOverflow's](http://stackoverflow.com/) management approach for example, that is to make sure that everyone can do their job and get the hell out of their way. Or I've heard someone use this "I'm on a bullet train" expression to refer to his commitment to achieving the goal in time. There is no "subtle control" but a heads down commitment and everyone is pushing forward as hard as they can.

When agile is a adopted as an organization decision then something is already suspicious. To simplify, the people I worked with in Hellas didn't need someone to say to them "do agile". We already did of a sort. Maybe not a perfect one, because god knows we needed some structure, but agile is about pursuing the best possible and always improving. They just needed the opposing elements to go away and let their productive reach the end user. When agile is adopted or better enforced as an organizational decision, all opposing elements will find their way into the new system usually as part of a process or such. But agile is about the people and not the process, so at the end of the day, with or without agile, nothing really changed.

The problem I have with Meijer's reasoning is that it's all based in the principal that all software engineers can be inspired by the "Hackers way" approach. Unfortunately that approach is not dominant in the human society not only for software engineers but for all professions. Most people work for a living and if it happens that they love their work, then they could be on board with this approach. But even then, they have to deal with the "subtle control" owners of the people that do not understand their passion. As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing wrong with working for a living. Not everyone can be the best in his field and many people have other interests. Most people need leaders to follow, leaders who would pave the ground for them to move forward as quickly as possible. Leaders who have vision and embrace the hackers way mentality. Leaders that want to get the job done. Leaders who understand that talk is cheap and actions say more. And in that context, hierarchy is kind of important. A leader who operates in non-blocking environment would be able to push everyone forward. He has enough energy, excitement and passion to carry the momentum forward. But a leader who operates in an environment full of blockers can't do much and gets frustrated. Such an environment will eventually lose their best assets because the core problem is that it allows and even promotes irrelevance, lack of knowledge, often incompetence and a no-doer attitude. Often these attitudes will be validated, as a necessary agile process and that drives people away because it simply doesn't make sense. In a perfect world where everyone is as equally passionate, the hierarchy is not required. The leader would be the group.

If you could get all the noise and negative forces out, then the neutral and leading forces would find their way into getting things done. It's like the soccer and marine team. Everyone wants to win although possibly not all as equally in the soccer team. For the marines the option of failure doesn't exist and as such the paradigm becomes irrelevant, for the simple reason that I won't die if my software goes bad or my fellow engineer gets sick or just codes for a living. The soccer team with all its wishful thinking, will sometime lose. It will lose and that's an acknowledgment to the better team. It will learn and it will try to improve. It might even learn a couple of things from the better team. But a high performing team will not accept sell outs nor people irrelevant to the sport. I could be an Jordan in basketball but if I don't understand soccer then I'm hurting the team. And that's the point I find the most interesting in the presentation. Why is there so much irrelevance around a software team, when software by it's high tech definition requires high performing operators? 

If you ask me, the biggest change the cloud brought to the industry is that it cannot allow dysfunctional organizations to survive in this race against time. It's brought high tech exploration and technology adoption to everyone involved with software and has given the end user very strong voice. This voice is very strong and when supported by others it embarases the product representative who tries to get out of the hear with words. Take a look at microsoft forums if you don't believe. Then compare feedback and discussions on github issues. If you can't follow, for whatever internal reasons, then you will eventually be left out of the game, because the game will have moved on and it won't wait. 

So my advice is, embrace the hacker way because it is agile. Use agile as means for constant improvement, even if some more talking ir required. Sometimes it's good not to code. That means, make sure you remove the negative forces, the irrelevant elements and keep the noise to its absolute minimum required. But most important of all, treat your hackers as the most important asset and in very simple terms get out of their way. If not financially, show your appreciation by letting them succeed. I'm confident that this mentality made former startups to the giants we all look up to.

I'll close with one proverb and a quote that I like from Mark Zuckerberg’s [letter to Investors: ‘The Hacker Way’](https://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/).

> **Be Bold**. Building great things means taking risks. This can be scary and prevents most companies from doing the bold things they should. However, in a world that’s changing so quickly, you’re guaranteed to fail if you don’t take any risks. We have another saying: “The riskiest thing is to take no risks.” We encourage everyone to make bold decisions, even if that means being wrong some of the time.
