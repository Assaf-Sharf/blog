##### The abstract

Jekyll is a simple static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites, such as [this one](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/). Based on ruby, its easy to add plugins using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) by adding them to the Gemfile, like this:

```gem "jekyll-rdf", "~> 3.2"```

Resource description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data interchange, using graphs instead of tables. Rendering RDF data into the web pages is the basis of the semantic web approach as defined by Tim Berners-Lee.

Jekyll RDF is a plugin for Jekyll allowing rendering static web based on the RDF file.

This weeks open mic presentation introduces to the basis of installation and usage of the Jekyll RDF plugin and offers some scenarios in which it is suitable to use.
