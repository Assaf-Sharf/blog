This talk was given soon after jQuery added `$.Deferred`'s in 1.5. I had used them a lot at [Quick Left](http://www.quickleft.com) and discovered some helpful use cases for them that may not have been obvious and figured they were worth sharing.

The talk was [well rated](http://speakerrate.com/talks/11861-i-promise-to-show-you-when-to-use-deferreds-in-creative-ways) and continues to generate positive feedback.
