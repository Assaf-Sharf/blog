<p><p>Music library streaming service Plex has announced that it now natively supports TIDAL, the high fidelity audio streaming service.</p>
<p>This support integrates TIDAL or Plex Pass/Tidal combo subscribers' libraries with TIDAL's music catalog, showing recommendations from TIDAL for music not in a user's existing music library. This extends to, for example, listing the work you're missing of a musical artist you have in your library. It will also integrated TIDAL's 59 million song catalog into Plex's recently added artist radio functionality.</p>
<p>This integration also comes with new features for Plex. Two of these are universal playlists, which can incorporate songs from your own Plex server, shared servers, and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/tidal/'><img alt='Small TIDAL icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/tidal_100921.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />TIDAL</a>, as well as universal search, which now returns results from TIDAL alongside your server and shared servers.</p>
<p>Other functionality, such as gapless playback, audio level normalizing, soft pauses, and more are also implemented.
