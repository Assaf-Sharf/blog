<p><p>Microsoft has announced a radical shift in the development strategy of its flagship Edge web browser. This includes making it open-source, changing its foundation, and adding more compatible operating systems.</p>
<p>Joe Belfiore, Windows Corporate Vice President detailed these new plans publicly via <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/12/06/microsoft-edge-making-the-web-better-through-more-open-source-collaboration/" rel="nofollow">a post on Microsoft's official Windows Experience Blog</a>. The most dramatic change is using Chromium as the new basis for Edge's web platform. This is planned to be gradually implemented over the next year of updates to the web browser. The goal of this, according to Belfiore, is to align <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-edge/'><img alt='Small Microsoft Edge icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/microsoft-edge_85645.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Microsoft Edge</a> &quot;with web standards&quot; and &quot;with other <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/chromium/-based'><img alt='Small Chromium icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/chromium_79310.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Chromium</a> browsers&quot;.</p>
<p>In addition to this shift to Chromium as a base, Edge will also be released and actively updated not just for <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/windows-10/'><img alt='Small Windows 10 icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/windows-10_82838.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Windows 10</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a>, and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_88776.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a>, but also for <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/mac-os/'><img alt='Small macOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/mac-os_132940.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />macOS</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/windows-7/'><img alt='Small Windows 7 icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/windows-7_94498.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Windows 7</a>, and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/windows-8/'><img alt='Small Windows 8 icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/windows-8_33098.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Windows 8</a>.</p>
<p>The last change mentioned in this announcement is that Microsoft will be contributing the enhancements made to Chromium through Edge's development to all Chromium-based web browsers for Windows. This has been received positively by other web browser distributors. Spokespeople for Google and Opera both responded positively to this announcement according to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/06/google-and-mozilla-react-to-microsofts-embrace-of-chromium/" rel="nofollow">a VentureBeat article by Emil Protalinski</a>. Mozilla CEO Chris Beard, however, published <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/" rel="nofollow">a scathing post on the official Mozilla blog</a>, with quotes such as this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is officially giving up on an independent shared platform for the internet. By adopting Chromium, Microsoft hands over control of even more of online life to Google. This may sound melodramatic, but it’s not. The “browser engines” — Chromium from Google and Gecko Quantum from Mozilla — are “inside baseball” pieces of software that actually determine a great deal of what each of us can do online. They determine core capabilities such as which content we as consumers can see, how secure we are when we watch content, and how much control we have over what websites and services can do to us. Microsoft’s decision gives Google more ability to single-handedly decide what possibilities are available to each one of us.</p>
