<p><p>Google today announced at the Android Dev Summit several updates that Android will receive over the next year, including native support for today's announced foldable devices from Samsung, updates to the Kotlin programming language, and a new version on Android Studio. For most consumers, however, the biggest news announced for the OS today is support for apps to update in the background while they are being used.</p>
<p><a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/11/unfolding-right-now-at-androiddevsummit.html" rel="nofollow">In a blog post on the Android Developers Blog</a>, Android's Director of Product Management Stephanie Cuthbertson detailed these changes, alongside the launch of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android-studio/'><img alt='Small Android Studio icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android-studio_97433.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android Studio</a> beta 3. Again, though, the most notable change that will impact a large amount of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a> users is the implementation of what Cuthbertson refers to as an In-app Updates Application Program Interface. According to Cuthbertson, this will give developers two options:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first is a full-screen experience for critical updates when you expect the user to wait for the update to be applied immediately. The second option is a flexible update, which means the user can keep using the app while the update is downloaded. [Developers] can completely customize the update flow so it feels like part of your app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No date was provided for when the In-app Updates API will be implemented.</p>
