<p><p>Privacy-conscious users of either Facebook or Instagram should take note of a new setting that could allow location data from one to be shared with the other.</p>
<p>Less than two weeks following the departure of the original founders of Instagram, Facebook has begun prototyping a new setting that will allow location data gathered from the photo sharing network's mobile app to be sent to Facebook for ad targeting and comment recommendation.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/instagram-location-history/" rel="nofollow">a response to TechCrunch</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/facebook/'><img alt='Small Facebook icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/facebook_75888.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Facebook</a> states that it &quot;[hasn’t] introduced updates to [its] location settings.&quot; The statement also details that &quot;<a href='//alternativeto.net/software/instagram/'><img alt='Small Instagram icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/instagram_112969.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Instagram</a> does not currently store Location History; we’ll keep people updated with any changes to our location settings in the future.”</p>
<p>Facebook's new privacy setting was originally discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1047918370698354689" rel="nofollow">by Jane Manchun Wong on Twitter</a>.</p>
