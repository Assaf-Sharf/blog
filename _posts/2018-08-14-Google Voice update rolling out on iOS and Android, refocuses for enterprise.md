<p>Google Voice is being renovated to bring it more in line with use for enterprise customers.</p><p>As Google Voice is now a part of the company's G Suite group of applications, the app has now rearranged its features to accommodate this change in focus. </p><p>Now, when users are logged in, the first tab that they will see is the Calls tab. This reflects https://alternativeto.net/software/google-voice/'s focus on traditional telephone calls. Next is the brand new Contacts tab which integrates with your address book. This is followed by Messages and, finally, Voicemail.</p><p>Google Voice's Do Not Disturb feature will automatically be activated and deactivated according to users' working hours within https://alternativeto.net/software/google-calendar/.</p><p>For non-enterprise G Suite customers, enhanced Do Not Disturb functionality and Google Calendar integration will not be available.</p><p>[According to 9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2018/08/13/google-voice-ios-redesign-icon/), These features, alongside a new logo for the design refresh, are available now on iOS, with Android users receiving this update gradually.</p>
