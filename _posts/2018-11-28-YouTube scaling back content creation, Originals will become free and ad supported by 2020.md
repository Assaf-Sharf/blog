<p><p>YouTube confirmed multiple outlets' reports that it will be scaling back production of its original shows and programs and offering them for free (with advertisements) by 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/youtube-pull-back-scripted-programming-ad-supported-push-1164256" rel="nofollow">Originally reported by Hollywood Reporter</a>, YouTube executives do not wish to compete with the billions of dollars of investment that YouTube Original content competes against from the likes of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/amazon-video/'><img alt='Small Amazon Video icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/amazon-video_86554.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Amazon Video</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/hulu/'><img alt='Small Hulu icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/hulu_97590.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Hulu</a>, and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/netflix/'><img alt='Small Netflix icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/netflix_98388.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Netflix</a>.</p>
<p>This strategy was confirmed by YouTube <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-originals-strategy-free-ad-supported-shows-scripted-1203037846/" rel="nofollow">to Variety</a>, where a spokesperson put out the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we look to 2019, we will continue to invest in scripted programming and shift to make our YouTube Originals ad supported to meet the growing demand of a more global fanbase. This next phase of our originals strategy will expand the audience of our YouTube Original creators, and provide advertisers with incredible content that reaches the YouTube generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The move aims to have this currently paywall protected content to all of the current 2 billion users of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/youtube/'><img alt='Small YouTube icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/youtube_115696.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />YouTube</a> worldwide by 2020. In the meantime, content like season 2 of Cobra Kai will require users to subscribe to YouTube Premium, which costs 12 U.S. dollars a month.</p>
