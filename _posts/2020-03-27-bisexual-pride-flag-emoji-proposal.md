**Update 11/20: Sign the [petition](https://change.org/BiFlagEmoji)!**

On February 3, I submitted the first proposal for the Bisexual Pride Flag Emoji. During this time, I was also consulting with friends and the pioneers behind the [transgender flag emoji](https://www.tedeytan.com/transemoji). Based upon the feedback I received, I resubmitted an updated proposal on February 5. On February 11, I noticed the proposal listed on the Unicode Requests page. [Here]({{site.url}}/assets/documents/Proposal_For_Bisexual_Flag_Emoji.pdf) is the latest version of the proposal.

Despite emoji being a universal language used everyday by people all around the world, a handful of people in San Francisco at the Unicode Consortium decide the fate of new emojis. The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee accepts proposals for new emoji based upon criteria like is the emoji distinguishable at its small size, does the emoji contribute to the conversation, and will a large amount of people likely use the new emoji. They have a [template](https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html#emoji_proposals_form) for submitting a proposal, and each point is addressed in the proposal I submitted. 

Once I received confirmation that my proposal was received, I waited, anxiously. The transgender flag took 4 years, a team of people from around the world, and intense public pressure. There was even a [documentary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5y5Sfh__-s) on YouTube about the process they had to go through. I had written the proposal in less than a day and couldn‚Äôt find a single article from a reputable source advocating for a bisexual flag emoji.

On March 24, I received a reply from the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee:

![The Emoji Subcommittee has carefully reviewed your proposal for a bisexual flag emoji. After much consideration we regret to inform you that we are unable to recommend emojification for general interchange. We recognize that this message may come as a disappointment. Please accept the best wishes from the Subcommittee. Sincerely, The Emoji Subcommittee](/assets/images/unicode_reply.png)

They provided no reason for the rejection, which indicates that despite following their guidelines for the proposal, they didn't see the bisexual community deserving an emoji to express themselves. Yet, even pirates have a flag (üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è).

[![The bisexual flag emoji was declined without a reason](/assets/images/emoji_rejection.png)](https://unicode.org/emoji/emoji-requests.html)

I knew this wouldn‚Äôt be easy from the start. The transgender flag emoji required multiple submissions, a team of people, and intense media coverage. I was the only person who worked on this first submission. That may have been a mistake, but I wanted to submit the proposal in time for the deadline.

So, what‚Äôs next? To move forward, I think it‚Äôs best to recruit some more people in this effort, talk strategy, and try to get some media coverage. The more attention we can bring to this, the more pressure we can put on Unicode. Ultimately, I want to submit the proposal again, but we need to come back stronger than before. If you want to help this happen, please [reach out](mailto:hey@tannermarino.com). Together, we can bring visibility to bisexual people everywhere.

Someone shared with me that there is a bisexual flag emoji in Skype. This is great for bi visibility and supports our iniative. When companies begin implementing emojis on their own when Unicode fails to do so, it adds pressure for Unicode to act. Shoutout to Skype for leading with us and their inclusion of several pride flag emojis.

## Update: November 16, 2020
Thanks to everyone who has reached out for the support so far. Today, we launched the a [petition](https://change.org/BiFlagEmoji) to gather signatures to show the support the emoji has and increase awareness of the issue. So far we have over 200 supporters. I encourage all of our supporters and allies to sign and share the petition. This is just the beginning. More to come.

## Update: November 23, 2020
A week later, we've surpassed 8,500 supporters on the petition! We were also featured on [LGBTQ Nation](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/11/bisexual-activist-asked-bi-flag-emoji-group-governs-emojis-said-no/) and [queer.de](https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=35793) (German). Thanks again to everyone for the support and for sharing the petition. We are making good progress!

## Update: November 25: 2 more articles and 12,500 supporters
Yesterday we reached 10,000 and today we are still climbing (currently at 12,500). An article in [Pink News](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/11/24/bisexual-pride-flag-emoji-plans-rejected-unicode-consortium-tanner-marino/) was released yesterday, and one in [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/bisexual-pride-flag-emoji-rejected-by-unicode/) was released today (also available in [Spanish](https://www.homosensual.com/lgbt/bisexuales/dejaron-a-la-bandera-bisexual-fuera-de-los-nuevos-emojis/)). We've received many comments on the petition, social media and articles in various languages spanning the globe. People from all over the world support adding a bi flag emoji. Thanks to everyone for the support so far, including Change.org staff for their help. If you haven't already, consider sharing the petition!

## Update: December 2: 15,000 supporters.
Wow. In just over two weeks (17 days), we hit 15,000 signatures. We are building a movement. The momentum and support so far has been outstanding. This is an important milestone worth celebrating. Still, we have a ways to go: we haven't heard from Unicode or from any of their voting members (Apple, Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, etc). Let's keep up the momentum: if we each shared the petition to just one more person, we could double our supporters to reach 30,000.
