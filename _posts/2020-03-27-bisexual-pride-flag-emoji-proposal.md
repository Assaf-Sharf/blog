title: "Bisexual Pride Flag Emoji Proposal"

On February 3, I submitted the first proposal for the Bisexual Pride Flag Emoji. During this time, I was also consulting with friends and the pioneers behind the [transgender flag emoji](https://www.tedeytan.com/transemoji). Based upon the feedback I received, I resubmitted an updated proposal on February 5. On February 11, I noticed the proposal listed on the Unicode Requests page. [Here]({{site.url}}/assets/documents/Proposal_For_Bisexual_Flag_Emoji.pdf) is the latest version of the proposal.

Then, I waited, anxiously. The transgender flag took 4 years, a team of people from around the world, and intense public pressure. There was even a [documentary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5y5Sfh__-s) on YouTube about the process they had to go through. I had written the proposal in less than a day and couldn’t find a single article from a reputable source advocating for a bisexual flag emoji.

On March 24, I received a reply from the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee:

> The Emoji Subcommittee has carefully reviewed your proposal for a bisexual flag emoji. After much consideration we regret to inform you that we are unable to recommend emojification for general interchange.

I knew this wouldn’t be easy from the start. The transgender flag emoji required multiple submissions, a team of people, and intense media coverage. I was the only person who worked on this first submission. That may have been a mistake, but I wanted to submit the proposal in time for the deadline.

So, what’s next? To move forward, I think it’s best to recruit some more people in this effort, talk strategy, and try to get some media coverage. The more attention we can bring to this, the more pressure we can put on Unicode. Ultimately, I want to submit the proposal again, but we need to come back stronger than before.
