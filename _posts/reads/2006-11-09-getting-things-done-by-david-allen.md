A month or more ago I attended a day-long class about improving my productivity 
through organizing my tasks and information in Outlook. In fact, I began 
organizing my email with the 4 D's using the techniques from the class. I’m 
really digging it. I decided to take the class a few steps further and see 
what else I can do in my life to get more organized so I went to our group’s 
organizational expert for some advice. He pointed me in the direction of 
David Allen so I picked up [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142000280) 
and started reading.

I liked it and found a lot of value. Honestly, it was another pretty easy read. 
I didn’t do too many of [read that as ‘none of’] the exercises in the book 
and was able to finish it in less than a week. I figured with my first read 
through I would just try to digest the overall concepts and then see where/how 
I could fit them into my life. It helped solidify several of the concepts I 
pulled out of the day-long class.

Here are some specific areas that I found interesting and helpful:

Allen bases his methodology on two key objectives:

> Capturing all the things that need to get done — now, later, someday, 
big, little, or in between — into a logical and trusted system outside 
of your head and off your mind.

> Disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the 
‘inputs’ you let into your life so that you’ll always have a plan for 
‘next actions’ that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.

Both of these objectives really rang true for me. I have always been 
organized, but with a bad habit of procrastinating with my decisions. 
Forcing myself to make decisions up front [like applying the 4 Ds 
when processing email] has been a tremendously positive change.

> If it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. 

Allen discusses a zen-like approach to clarity of thought and how it 
leads to drastic advances in our thought processes. The gist of it is 
that if your mind is freed from having to keep track of grocery lists, 
project to-dos, meeting reminders, etc. then you can let it work on the 
bigger issues in your life like how to design a new product or what 
it really might take for you to go on that dream vacation to Europe. If 
you write it down (physically or electronically) and store it somewhere 
you trust, the mental benefits/gains are exponential.

> The big difference between what I do and what others do is that I capture 
and organize 100 percent of my ‘stuff’ _in and with objective tools at hand, 
not in my mind._ And that applies to everything — little or big, personal 
or professional, urgent or not. Everything. 

I have started doing this using Outlook tasks and it really is refreshing 
to know that I have one place to go whenever I need to look up notes, lists 
or next-actions. It takes a certain amount of discipline to capture 
everything, as David does, but it really is liberating after awhile.

> What’s the Next Action? … The ‘next action’ is the next physical, visible 
activity that needs to be engaged in, in order to move the current reality 
toward completion. 

This is often an elusive thing when dealing with projects or even worse, 
multiple projects at the same time. Simplifying a project down to the single 
next action that needs to take place in order to move forward can provide 
clear direction…not only for yourself, but others you are working with. I 
see way too many project meetings that end without any clear action items 
and these are the projects that inevitably stall and then fizzle into 
nothing. Months later you find yourself asking someone ‘whatever happened 
to project X?’ Ugh.

> The Natural Planning Model 
> * Defining purpose and principles 
> * Outcome visioning 
> * Brainstorming 
> * Organizing 
> * Identifying next actions 

I see so many projects that exclude, ignore or forget one or more of these 
pieces and they always seem so unorganized. In fact, just a few weeks ago 
I was in a 3 hour meeting that included loads of brainstorming.  Early in 
the meeting I became confused [I am a late-comer to the project] and asked 
for # 1 or 2 above to give me some clarity. I got blank stares in return. 
D’oh! How can we effectively brainstorm a design or concept if we don’t 
even know what the purpose and vision are?

Don’t be afraid to ask why. Why are we meeting? Why am I in this meeting? 
Why are we trying to accomplish this? Why do the requestors think they 
need this solution? Yada-yada-yada… Here are Allen’s listed __benefits of 
asking “why?”__ and I couldn’t agree more:

> It defines success.   
> It creates decision-making criteria.   
> It aligns resources.  
> It motivates.  
> It clarifies focus.   
> It expands options.  

[Mind-mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Mapping) as a brainstorming 
exercise. This looks pretty interesting.

On filing systems: 

> The lack of a good general-reference system can be one of the greatest 
obstacles to implementing a personal management system, and for more of 
the executives I have personally coached, it represents one of the biggest 
opportunities for improvement.

I’m a pack-rat when it comes to documents and such. I had a huge file 
cabinet full of stuff going back 20+ years. A lot of it was irrelevant, 
but more importantly it was filed very inefficiently. The system only made 
sense to me and was cumbersome. In a nutshell, Allen recommends making your 
filing system as simple as possible. Start with a simple set of folders 
labeled A-Z and only make specific-labeled folders for those things you 
need. So I spent a weekend purging my files and re-organizing them. Not 
only was I able to shred 65% of the files, but I simplified the system so 
that everything is easy to find. Bills are under B instead of a separate 
folder for each company, house information is in H, medical stuff is under 
M, etc. That was a big monkey off my back. 

Organizing action reminders &ndash; I’m still working this one out to find 
a way that works well for me, but Allen gives a lot of good suggestions. 
Basically, if something needs to be done on a certain date/time then put it 
on your calendar. Other next actions should be organized by context, 
whatever context makes the most sense to you (phone calls, errands, office, 
read/review, at computer, etc.).

Weekly review &ndash; Probably one of the most important aspects to 
implementing Allen’s system! Once you start collecting all of your 
thoughts/ideas/actions in a trusted place you need to review them regularly 
so they’re not missed. The weekly review is one such point-in-time where 
you spend a few hours organizing the loose things (email, papers, notes, 
lists, etc.), reviewing your next actions, clearing your mind and 
double-checking yourself. Here are the things that Allen suggests for 
a weekly review:

* Process all loose papers. 
* Process your notes from journal entries, meetings or scribbled reminders. 
* Review past calendar dates for remaining action items, reference information, etc. 
* Look at future calendar events for any prep work you might need to do. 
* Clear your mind by writing down all of your project ideas, action items, etc. 
* Evaluate your projects for status and any action items. 
* Review your lists (next actions, waiting for, someday/maybe) for any items 
that can be marked as finished or needs to be updated. 

> Your negative feelings are simply the result of breaking those agreements.

Allen is referring to our agreements with ourselves when we have something in our ‘inbox’ or tell ourselves we will do something, but then we don’t complete it. 

> If you tell yourself to draft a strategic plan, when you don’t do it, you’ll feel bad. Tell yourself to get organized, and if you fail to, welcome to guilt and frustration. 

We are our own worst critic, right?

Interesting quotes from the book:

> It is hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head. &ndash; Sally Kempton

> It does not take much strength to do things, but it requires a great deal of strength to decide what to do. &ndash; Elbert Hubbard 

> Fanaticism consists of redoubling your efforts when you have forgotten your aim. &ndash; George Santayana

> The best way to get a good idea is to get lots of ideas. &ndash; Linus Pauling 

> If you’re not totally sure what your job is, it will always feel overwhelming. &ndash; David Allen 

> Let our advance worrying become advance thinking and planning. &ndash; Winston Churchill 

> People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don’t 
believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people 
who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can’t find 
them, make them. &ndash; George Bernard Shaw 

The thing I really liked about this book, besides all of the organizational 
tips/suggestions, is that Allen’s basic premise is to find a system that 
works best for you. The same system will not work for everyone and he states 
that frequently. He suggests you use his processes, but also realizes that 
you might want to take a hybrid approach [what I have done] and is ok with 
that. He writes the book with an open mind which, in my opinion, makes him 
even more credible.
