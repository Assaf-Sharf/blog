[![Becoming by Michelle Obama](/images/cover_Becoming_MichelleObama_150.jpg "Becoming by Michlle Obama"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136/)

This is my favorite memoir. Michelle is a wonderful writer, telling her life story
through her lens, this is her perspective and she's unafraid to delve into the
depth of her experiences.

She touches on every subject you would expect from an intelligent, caring woman
born into a close-knit middle-class family in South Side Chicago. She holds herself
to the highest standards, evident in her years of success at Ivy League universities
and her career as a lawyer and community outreach advocate for different Chicago
institutions. Eventually, she gets pulled into the roller coaster ride of a lifetime
as FLOTUS and provides an inside look at the emotional and physical toll of
campaigning and politics...as well as all the positive experiences she relished.
Michelle provides insight into what her life, and her family's, was like as we all
watched (and judged) from the outside.

It's no wonder that she was voted the most respected woman in the U.S. twice in a row
([2018](https://news.gallup.com/poll/245669/michelle-obama-ends-hillary-clinton-run-admired.aspx)
& [2019](https://news.gallup.com/poll/273125/obama-trump-tie-admired-man-2019.aspx)),
Michelle Obama deserves (and earned) it.
