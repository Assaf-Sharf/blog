In no particular order, these are some of my favorite books from my [2019 reading list](reading-list-2019).

[![Becoming by Michelle Obama](/images/cover_Becoming_MichelleObama_150.jpg "Becoming by Michelle Obama"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136/)

This is my favorite memoir. Michelle is a wonderful writer, telling her life story
through her lens, this is her perspective and she's unafraid to delve into the
depth of her experiences.

She touches on every subject you would expect from an intelligent, caring woman
born into a close-knit middle-class family in South Side Chicago. She holds herself
to the highest standards, evident in her years of success at Ivy League universities
and her career as a lawyer and community outreach advocate for different Chicago
institutions. Eventually, she gets pulled into the roller coaster ride of a lifetime
as FLOTUS and provides an inside look at the emotional and physical toll of
campaigning and politics...as well as all the positive experiences she relished.
Michelle provides insight into what her life, and her family's, was like as we all
watched (and judged) from the outside.

[![Blood for Blood by Victoria Selman](/images/cover_BloodForBlood_VictoriaSelman_150.jpg "Blood for Blood by Victoria Selman"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Blood-Ziba-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1503905055/)

I really enjoy the Ziba MacKenzie series by Victoria Selman (my type of mystery/suspense thriller):
[Blood for Blood](https://smile.amazon.com/Blood-Ziba-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1503905055/);
[Nothing to Lose](https://smile.amazon.com/Nothing-Lose-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1542041937/);
and [Snakes and Ladders](https://smile.amazon.com/Snakes-Ladders-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1542008794/).

The writing is engaging and succinct, the stories move at a swift pace, there are
more than a few surprising twists, and she explores the main character enough to
get to know and understand her a little better each time.

[![For the Love of Men: A New Vision for Mindful Masculinity by Liz Plank](/images/cover_ForTheLoveOfMen_LizPlank_150.jpg "For the Love of Men: A New Vision for Mindful Masculinity by Liz Plank"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Love-Men-Vision-Mindful-Masculinity/dp/1250196248/)

Liz conveys an atypical perspective on feminism, geared more towards men than women,
but results in advancing equality for all genders. 

Liz Plank takes the stereotypical concept of masculinity and turns it upside down.
What if men are the ones who benefit the most by redefining masculinity? Liz delves
into the details of how men define masculinity and what they think of societyâ€™s
expectations. She advocates for and describes how men can embrace the concept of
"mindful masculinity" to improve their own lives by altering societal expectations.
Gift this book to all of the men in your life!

[![The Testaments by Margaret Atwood](/images/cover_TheTestaments_MargaretAtwood_150.jpg "The Testaments by Margaret Atwood"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Testaments-Novel-Margaret-Atwood/dp/0593149092/)

An amazing follow up to 1985's [The Handmaid's Tale](https://smile.amazon.com/The-Handmaids-Tale/dp/3125776929/).
The story moves along swiftly while thoroughly addressing so many of the open questions from its prequel.

[![Saga by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples](/images/cover_Saga_BrianVaughan_FionaStaples_150.jpg "Saga by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Saga-Vol-1-Brian-Vaughan/dp/1607066017/)

A creative new spin on a tale as old as time...lovers caught in the crossfire of war.
The art is beautifully drawn and colored. The story is engaging and unique with the
thread of familiarity that allows us to easily relate.
