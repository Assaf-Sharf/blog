In no particular order, these are some of my favorite books from my [2019 reading list](reading-list-2019).

[![Becoming by Michelle Obama](/images/cover_Becoming_MichelleObama_150.jpg "Becoming by Michelle Obama"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136/)

This is my favorite memoir. Michelle is a wonderful writer, telling her life story
through her lens, this is her perspective and she's unafraid to delve into the
depth of her experiences.

She touches on every subject you would expect from an intelligent, caring woman
born into a close-knit middle-class family in South Side Chicago. She holds herself
to the highest standards, evident in her years of success at Ivy League universities
and her career as a lawyer and community outreach advocate for different Chicago
institutions. Eventually, she gets pulled into the roller coaster ride of a lifetime
as FLOTUS and provides an inside look at the emotional and physical toll of
campaigning and politics...as well as all the positive experiences she relished.
Michelle provides insight into what her life, and her family's, was like as we all
watched (and judged) from the outside.

It's no wonder that she was voted the most respected woman in the U.S. twice in a row
([2018](https://news.gallup.com/poll/245669/michelle-obama-ends-hillary-clinton-run-admired.aspx)
& [2019](https://news.gallup.com/poll/273125/obama-trump-tie-admired-man-2019.aspx)),
Michelle Obama deserves (and earned) it.

[![Blood for Blood by Victoria Selman](/images/cover_BloodForBlood_VictoriaSelman_150.jpg "Blood for Blood by Victoria Selman"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Blood-Ziba-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1503905055/)

I really enjoy the Ziba MacKenzie series by Victoria Selman:
[Blood for Blood](https://smile.amazon.com/Blood-Ziba-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1503905055/);
[Nothing to Lose](https://smile.amazon.com/Nothing-Lose-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1542041937/);
and [Snakes and Ladders](https://smile.amazon.com/Snakes-Ladders-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1542008794/).

The writing is engaging and succinct, the stories move at a swift pace, there are
more than a few surprising twists, and she explores the main character enough to
get to know and understand her a little better each time. Recommended for
mystery/crime readers!

The main character, Ziba MacKenzie, is intelligent, strong-willed, introspective,
and confident. She also has a tendency to be impetuous, insecure, emotionally closed
off, and judgmental. All of these things, strengths and flaws, are what make her
relatable and interesting. Hearing her reasoning and thoughts as she moves through
the case and her own life, give us insight into the why's behind her actions, even
when we might be saying "no, don't do that!" I appreciated and enjoyed understanding
the internal conflicts Ziba goes through.

The author writes the type of mystery/suspense thriller I enjoy. The plot moves quickly,
takes several turns, leads us down a few different dead end paths, and allows us to
get to know the characters along the way. Selman describes the crimes and scenes
thoroughly without spending pages upon pages on every detail.
