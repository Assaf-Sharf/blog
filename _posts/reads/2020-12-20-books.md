Books I've read, ordered chronologically. See my top reads from [2020](/reads/top-reads-2020)
and [2019](/reads/top-reads-2019).

I've always been a reader, mostly voracious and other times...not so much (parenthood will do
that to you). I finally started keeping track of what I was reading after one-too-many times
where I bought a book, got a few chapters in, and realized I had already read it years before.
Oops. Here's the list, going all the way back to 2011. 

* Books I really enjoyed are marked with two plus signs. ++
* <i>Graphic novels & comics are italicized.</i>
* Books I didn't finish are marked as [abandoned](#abandoned).

I also use [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/todhilton).

# Abandoned

Books I didn't finish are marked as [abandoned](#abandoned).

Why didn't I finish the book? I like to read one book at a time and years ago it took me
months to slug my way through [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1938583995?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)
that everyone kept telling me "keep reading, it gets better, you'll love it." Nope, didn't
love it...or even like it. Lesson learned. If I don't enjoy a book within the first 30-50
pages, I stop reading it. There are way too many amazing [authors and books out there](https://sketchplanations.com/3500-lifetime-reads)
in the world for me to enjoy, not to mention my lengthy to-read list
([tsundoku](https://sketchplanations.com/tsundoku)).
