\-- <span style="font-size:smaller;"> Why didn't I finish this book? I like to read one book at a time and years ago it took me
months to slug my way through [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1938583995?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)
that everyone kept telling me "keep reading, it gets better, you'll love it." Nope, didn't
love it...or even like it. Lesson learned. If I don't enjoy a book within the first 30-50
pages, I stop reading it. There are way too many amazing authors and books out there in the
world for me to enjoy.</span>
