[![Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay](/images/cover_BadFeminist_RoxaneGay_200.jpg "Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay"){: .align-right }](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Feminist-Essays-Roxane-Gay/dp/0062282719/)

> My favorite definition of "feminist" is one offered by Su, an Australian 
woman who, when interviewed for Kathy Bail's 1996 anthology _DIY Feminism_, 
said feminists are "just women who don't want to be treated like shit."

Roxane Gay writes in a casual, intellectual, and engaging manner that keeps 
your attention. The essays challenge your presumptions, often with dry wit 
and in-depth analysis derived from her education, observations and life 
experiences. Her biographical stories and anecdotes are entertaining and 
enlightening, allowing you to empathize with her various experiences. 

This book significantly impacted my perspective on feminism. In particular, 
the imperfection of advocating feminism in our world. We all have different 
experiences and perspectives which drive our expectations. In her words, the 
stereotypical feminist is the "angry, sex-hating, man-hating victim lady 
person." Not seeing herself that way at all, Gay has spent a lot of time and 
brain power deciphering exactly what feminism means to her.

> I disavowed feminism because I had no rational understanding of the movement. 
I was called a feminist, and what I heard was, "You are an angry, sex-hating, 
man-hating victim lady person."

Precisely because she doesn't feel as though she fits the stereotype nor does 
she react to every scenario as she views a true feminist should, she describes 
herself as a **bad feminist**. Gay uses these essays to empower herself and 
the reader to embrace her/their imperfections while still being a feminist.

How did this book affect me? It opened my eyes in ways I didn't expect.

Like so many others in this world, after my parents divorced I was raised 
primarily by a single mother. That experience ingrained in me a sense of 
feminism that I didn't even realize was there for many years. While I have 
always respected women, appreciated them for who they are, treated them 
fairly, and supported equality in every way, I never really thought of myself 
as a feminist.

Perhaps itâ€™s a larger hurdle to leap because I'm a man. I'm _supposed_ to 
adhere to idiotic and outdated rules of masculinity if I want to _keep my man 
card_. In a way, labeling myself a feminist is the antithesis of the societal 
norms I experienced growing up in rural Illinois and then urban, yet deeply 
southern in its beliefs, Houston, Texas. Not all, but most of the men around 
me upheld those expectations while the boys strived to meet them. I suppose 
that makes for a long journey to embracing yourself as a man and a feminist.

Gay's descriptions opened my perspective into both that of a woman and being a 
black woman. For her it's a double whammy with the hammer of inequality. She 
didn't focus on that aspect of her experience as much as I'm sure she could. 
And while I'm fully aware of the systemic bias present in our society and 
government, her essays lent a personal light to the subject. Her view on 
current movies and books that supposedly shed light on racism were eye-opening. 
They often exposed the narrow scope and hypocritical story of enlightenment 
that the public embraced. Her analysis made me question why I enjoyed the 
subjects of her ire, to which I don't yet have a definitive answer.

---

> I enjoy difference, but once in a while, I do want to catch a glimpse of 
  myself in others.

Gay discusses how women, particularly black women, are underrepresented in the 
media. Everyone wants to a see a version of themselves in a movie, TV show, 
book, or commercial, even if only for a brief moment of recognition. It's 
empowering and reinforces how you view yourself, especially in the context of 
society. 

---

> To have privilege in one or more areas does not mean you are wholly privileged.

Her thoughts echo my own on the subject of privilege. Our perspective distorts 
our idea of the subject, often seeing (and even condemning) privilege in others 
before being able recognize our own. 

> Privilege is relative and contextual.  Few people in the developed world, 
  and particularly in the United States, have no privilege at all. Among those 
  of us who have participate in intellectual communities, privilege runs rampant. 
  We have disposable time and the ability to access the Internet regularly. We 
  have the freedom to express our opinions without the threat of retaliation. We 
  have smartphones and iProducts and desktops and laptops. If you are reading 
  this essay, you have some kind of privilege. It may be hard to hear that, I 
  know, but if you cannot recognize your privilege, you have a lot of work to 
  do; get started.

Extensive descriptions of her dedication to competitive Scrabble provide many 
details, which I found to be too much for me to enjoy. It was entertaining for 
a little while but turned tedious, probably due to my own disinterest in the 
game. I did find her attitude particularly interesting, confirming the bias of 
my armchair psychological philosophy that extreme confidence usually masks 
insecurity.

> I approach most things in life with a dangerous level of confidence to 
  balance my generally low self-esteem.

---

> It's okay if most of your friends are guys, but if you champion this as a 
  commentary on the nature of female friendships, well, soul-search a little.

The chapter, _How to be Friends with Another Woman_, challenges and also 
confirms some of the stereotypes I've heard over the years about women 
interacting with each other. I translate her advice to simply mean: 
_treat people with respect and kindness and don't be an asshole_. Those are 
my words, not hers. She provides several specific examples of how to do this, 
gleaned from her thirty-some years of experience as a woman, and I agree with 
each and every one of them. Many, if not all, can be applied to any friendship 
or relationship, regardless of gender.

> Don't be totally rude about truth telling, and consider how much truth is 
  actually needed to get the job done. Finesse goes a long way.

Remember that point about finesse going a long way.

Her in-depth analyses of pop culture, TV shows, and books were mostly enjoyable 
and informative. I found the analyses of the shows I haven't seen or books I 
haven't read lengthy and less engaging, primarily due to my lack of interest in 
the subject matter. 

Meanwhile, her discussion of The Help (movie) was enlightening. I haven't read 
the book, but really enjoyed the movie. Providing her perspective as a black 
woman made me question why I enjoyed the movie. What prejudice and preconceived 
ideology did I bring with me that prevented me from seeing the many issues she 
outlines? Granted, as a white man, it's not necessarily easy for me to put 
myself in the shoes of a black woman living in the southern U.S. during 1962. 
Not only am I having to empathize across gender, but race and socio-economic 
distinctions. Gay's analysis helped me understand things I completely missed 
and, quite frankly, I'm ashamed to have missed them.

> _The Help_ is billed as inspirational, charming, and heartwarming. That's all 
  true if your heart is warmed by narrow, condescending, mostly racist depictions 
  of the white women who employed _the help_; the excessive, inaccurate use of 
  dialect; and the glaring omissions with regards to the stirring civil rights 
  movement in which, as Martha Southgate points out in _Entertainment Weekly_, 
  "white people were the help"; "the architects, visionaries, prime movers, and 
  most of the on-the-ground laborers of the civil rights movement were 
  African-American. _The Help_, I have decided, is science fiction, creating an 
  alternate universe.

Her description of reality television, such as The Bachelor, is one of the 
primary reasons the show has never appealed to me. 

> The genre has developed a very successful formula for reducing women to an 
  awkward series of stereotypes about low self-esteem, marital desperation, the 
  inability to develop meaningful relationships with other women, and an 
  obsession with an almost pornographic standard of beauty. 

Ironically, she admits to enjoying the various shows, which contributes to her 
self-definition as a bad feminist. In her mind and opinion, a **true feminist** 
wouldn't watch them, let alone enjoy them. One more example of her being a 
**bad feminist**.

I recognize this in myself, especially as a white heterosexual man. I enjoy 
comedy that highlights differences in the genders, things that might be 
considered anti-feminist by some of the purist feminist crowd. I receive the 
benefits of white male privilege inherent in our patriarchal society, even if 
I didn't set out to attain them. It just so happened that I was born this way. 
Meanwhile, I'm passionate about equality and women's rights; to earn as much as 
their male peers, enjoy society without misogynistic harassment, make their own 
reproductive choices, state what's on their mind without judgment, and all the 
other areas in which women don't receive equal treatment.

> I am not always proud of the things that make me laugh, but I genuinely admire 
  a comedian who can both make me laugh and make me uncomfortable. Such 
  contradictions are thought provoking.

She discusses the concept of being likable in the essay _Not Here to Make Friends_. 
If a girl/woman doesn't fit the mold of what society deems to be likable 
characteristics and actions, they're immediately pigeonholed as a problem. 

> Even from a young age I understood that when a girl is unlikable, a girl is 
  a problem. I also understood that I wasn't being intentionally mean. I was 
  being honest (admittedly, without tact), and I was being human. It is either 
  a blessing or a curse that those are rarely likable qualities in a woman.

> In many ways, likability is a very elaborate lie, a performance, a code of 
  conduct dictating the proper way to be. Characters who don't follow this code 
  become unlikable.

Gay delves into the subject of fictional characters being likable or unlikable 
and how male and female characters are perceived differently. 

> An unlikable man is billed as an antihero, earning a special term to 
  explain those ways in which he deviates from the norm, the traditionally 
  likable.

> An unlikable man is inscrutably interesting, dark, or tormented, but 
  ultimately compelling, even when he might behave in distasteful ways.

> When women are unlikable, it becomes a point of obsession in critical 
  conversations by professional and amateur critics alike. Why are these women 
  daring to flaunt convention? Why aren't they making themselves likable (and 
  therefore acceptable) to polite society?

In her reading, she often finds herself rooting for the unlikable characters 
because they feel more honest, more alive&mdash;even human.

---

> If women's fortunes improve, it must mean men's fortunes will suffer, as 
  if there is a finite amount of good fortune in the universe that cannot be 
  shared equally between men and women.

In _How We All Lose_, she discusses how men feel disempowered, as if they're 
going to lose rights, simply by granting and embracing equal rights to women. 
Gay also describes how women dismiss their own equality by comparing their 
rights, as they currently stand, in the U.S. with those of women in third-world 
countries. Just because women have it better in the U.S., doesn't mean that they 
have an equal standing with men. Throughout this chapter, she provides thoughtful 
analysis of several other authors' works that deal with feminism. 

> Feminists are celebrating our victories and acknowledging our privilege when 
  we have it. We're simply refusing to settle. We're refusing to forget how much 
  work there is yet to be done. We're refusing to relish the comforts we have at 
  the expense of the women who are still seeking comfort. 

---

She touches on body image, fat camp, and how a horrific experience caused her 
to turn to overeating as a way of protection. Her description of the event was 
heartbreaking to read. It's even more heartbreaking to know that it's an 
experience many girls and women have gone through. In discussing the phrase 
_rape culture_, she discusses how it becomes dismissive of the ways rape affects 
the victim, focusing more on the perspective of the perpetrators, primarily men. 
We should flip the conversation.

These quotes stand by themselves. 

> Respectability politics&mdash;the idea that if black (or other marginalized) 
  people simply behave in "culturally approved" ways, if we mimic the dominant 
  culture, it will be more difficult to suffer the effects of racism.

> Respectability politics completely overlook institutional racism and the 
  ways in which the education system, the social welfare system, and the justice 
  system only reinforce many of the problems the black community faces.

> We must stop pointing to the exceptions&mdash;these bright shining starsÂ who 
  transcend circumstance. We must look to how we can best support the least among 
  us, not spend all our time blindly revering and trying to mimic the greatest 
  without demanding systemic change.

Political conservatives have been attacking people's access to birth control 
and limiting sex education through legislation for decades now, advocating 
abstinence as the only option. You only have to look at the proposed defunding 
of Planned Parenthood or the abortion legislation in Texas (and several other 
states) which is obviously designed to limit access, not improve safety as they 
claim.

The following quote had me laughing out loud while also thinking "what a stupid 
double standard."

> In certain circles, birth control is being framed as whore medicine. We are 
  now dealing with a bizarre new morality where a woman cannot simply say, in 
  one way or another, "I'm on the pill because I like dick."

Gay frames her discussion around the reality that women's rights are 
_not inalienable_ when it comes to their bodies or sexual choices. 

> Often, when I read the news, I have to make sure I am not, in fact, reading 
  _The Onion_. We continue to have national and state debates about abortion, 
  birth control, and reproductive freedom, and men, mostly, are directing that 
  debate. That is the stuff of satire.

> Women have been forced underground for contraception and pregnancy termination 
  before, and we will go underground again if we have to. We will risk our lives 
  if these politicians, who so flagrantly demean women, force us to do so.

> What this debate shows us is that even in this day and age, the rights of 
women are not inalienable. Our rights can be and are, with alarming regularity, 
stripped away.

An unfortunate truth that is undeniable **and** that we need to change.

She ends by reinforcing her dedication to being a feminist, along with her 
insecurities that she isn't doing it right or well enough. 

> I fall short as a feminist. I feel like I am not as committed as I need to 
  be, that I am not living up to feminist ideals because of who and how I 
  choose to be.

> No matter what issues I have with feminism, I am a feminist. I cannot and 
  will not deny the importance and absolute necessity of feminism. Like most 
  people, I'm full of contradictions, but I also don't want to be treated like 
  shit for being a woman. I am a bad feminist. I would rather be a bad feminist 
  the no feminist at all.

After reading this, I find that I'm a **bad feminist** too.
