Succinctly written (I read it in less than an hour) with several good 
recommendations for best practices. As the title states, this is an 
introductory book, yet Etter conveys many ideas and concepts that are 
solid reminders for all technical writers. Well worth the short time 
span to learn something new or refresh your knowledge.
