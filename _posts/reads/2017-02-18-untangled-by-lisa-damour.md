[Dr. Lisa Damour](https://www.drlisadamour.com/) breaks the topic of girls' 
adolescence into seven stages, allowing the reader to see the progression 
from child to young woman during the formative teen years. She writes in a 
conversational tone making it easy for the reader to follow. Describing several 
anecdotal stories from her decades of practicing psychology, Dr. Damour gives 
the reader multiple ways to handle scenarios they'll encounter in everyday life 
with their teenage girl.

1.  Parting with Childhood 
2.  Joining a New Tribe 
3.  Harnessing Emotions 
4.  Contending with Adult Authority 
5.  Planning for the Future 
6.  Entering the Romantic World 
7.  Caring for Herself 

She concludes each topic with succinct examples of when to worry about your 
daughter. I found these particularly helpful, especially since I won't always 
know what to look for in my daughter's behavior, attitude, or actions.

**Untangled** should be read by every parent as their daughter enters 
middle school or junior high! It's that well written, pertinent to your 
life, and important for your daughter's future womanhood. 

Further below you will find quotes and ideas from each area of the book that 
I found helpful and/or interesting. It's a long list to go through, yet it 
provides a resource for later review. I've found that repetition is one of the 
best ways for me to change my behavior and this comprehensive list will allow 
me to revisit the topic.

Before I get into the details, here are some of the high-level golden nuggets.

*  **Be compassionate.** The teenage brain is going through tremendous change 
   (scientifically proven) and it can make them highly emotional without (them 
   or you) understanding why. 
*  **Listen.** Truly be interested in what your teenage girl is saying. 
   They'll know if you're faking it. 
*  **Stop talking.** Don't assume their question is an invitation for a lecture. 
   Keep your answers short and to the point. 
*  **Externalization.** Daughters get rid of uncomfortable feelings by trying 
   to give them to parents (ironically, because they trust and feel comfortable 
   with us). Avoid taking urgent action or overreacting. 
*  **Opinions.** It's her right to disagree with you, and it's your right to 
   expect that she be civil while doing so. 
*  **She should be polite.** "_Put another way, I can be polite to people who 
   don't earn my respect._" 
*  **Apologize.** We all screw up. Admitting so, as a parent, teaches your 
   daughter it's going to happen and how to handle it with grace. 
*  **Growth mindset.** Girls are prone to "_explain failures in terms of 
   internal, permanent factors._" Remind her that open-mindedness, practice, 
   and dedication are the keys to building her skills. She can do anything she 
   puts her mind to. 
*  **Care for herself.** Do not dictate her behavior, rather frame it in the 
   context of how she can best take care of and nurture herself. 

And now for the comprehensive list of interesting ideas and quotes from each 
chapter. Particularly interesting ones are in **bold**.

## Parting with Childhood ##

*  "_Girls don't dump their parents just for the heck of it.... By age twelve 
   most tweens feel a sudden, internal pressure to separate themselves from 
   almost everything that seems childlike and...a girl's pleasant relationship 
   with her folks is usually one of the first casualties._" 
*  Begin "_by allowing your daughter more privacy than she had as a child._" 
   Let her go to her room, close the door, and be with herself doing her own 
   thing without prying. Privacy is paramount. 
*  **Research continues to show that eating dinner with their family benefits 
   teenage girls, even when they're not getting along with their parents.** 
*  Use time in the car to connect. "_Girls and their friends seem to forget 
   that the chauffeur is actually someone's mom or dad and will chatter quite 
   openly._" I've found this to be very true, especially when driving the carpool 
   with her friends. Do not try to engage in the conversation, that will only 
   break the illusion of being just the chauffeur. Be quiet and listen! 
*  If she isn't responsive to your questions about her life, friends, school, 
   activities, and hobbies, be sure that your questions are driven by genuine 
   interest. They can usually tell when parents are simply keeping tabs versus 
   sincerely interested in what they have to say. 
*  **Let your girls control the radio while driving. So simple, yet empowering.** 
*  Being polite is a more accurate goal than being respectful. "_Put another way, 
   I can be polite to people who don't earn my respect...._" 
*  "_People don't do nice things for people who are mean to them._" Daughters 
   often ask us to do things for them, such as run an errand on her behalf, but 
   if she's treated you poorly for the last few days you might not feel like it. 
   Dr. Damour recommends honesty along with empathy: "_I feel really torn. I love 
   you and want to help you out in any way I can, but you've been snarky for 
   days and I don't want to give you the impression that you can treat people 
   poorly and expect them to go out of their way for you._" Or if the situation 
   warrants it, "_No way, sister! Not with how you've been acting. Warm it up 
   several degrees and try again later._" 
*  **The swimming pool metaphor.** "_Your daughter is a swimmer, you are the pool 
   in which she swims, and the water is the broader world. Like any good 
   swimmer, your daughter wants to be out playing, diving, or splashing around 
   in the water. And, like any swimmer, she holds on to the edge of the pool 
   to catch her breath after a rough lap or getting dunked too many times._" 
*  "_Having a delicate conversation with a teenager is like trying to talk with 
   someone on the other side of a door._" When they prompt you with a question, 
   they only give you a tiny amount of space to respond. If you try to barge 
   in with all sorts of uninvited information they'll close up. 
*  Inappropriate clothing: "_Honey, you've captured a look meant for adults&mdash;it's 
   not appropriate at thirteen._" Or, "_that outfit will draw sexual 
   attention your way that, frankly, no one in this family is ready for._" 
   *  **Don't say she looks like a tramp. She will hear "I think you're a tramp." 
      Completely different.** 
*  Posting online. If she's talking big, don't believe everything, but also 
   don't be na√Øve. Tell her what you found online and ask her to explain. 
   Figure out what she was hoping to accomplish. 

## Joining a New Tribe ##

*  They're looking for a new tribe to join. This is significant! "_Teenagers 
   aren't just looking to make friends, they are replacing the family they've 
   withdrawn from...with a tribe that they can feel proud to call their own._" 
*  **Understand the difference between conflict and bullying.** Conflict among 
   humans is normal and something that all adolescents need to learn how to 
   deal with. Bullying is serious and potentially dangerous, and it needs to 
   be treated aggressively. "_Treating conflict as bullying is the equivalent 
   of prescribing a full-blown course of antibiotics for the common cold.... 
   Of course, treating bullying as if it were everyday conflict is the 
   equivalent of misdiagnosing pneumonia as a common cold&mdash;left untreated, 
   the situation can reach critical proportions._" 
*  Popularity - girls begin to value this because of what it seems to promise: 
   a place in a desirable tribe. This occurs at the same time they're pulling 
   away from their own family. 
   *  **Sociometric popularity** describes "_well-liked teens with reputations for 
      being kind and fun._" 
	 *  **Perceived popularity** describes "_teens who hold a lot of social power but 
      are disliked by many classmates._" 
	 *  **The key difference seems to be that popular nice girls aren't easy to 
      push around.** 
	 *  The author recommends **parents deconstruct the meaning of the term popular**. 
      Girls typically mean another girl is powerful, which is usually because 
      she's doing it to be mean and everyone knows it. Ask your daughter "_is 
      the girl popular or just powerful? Do kids like her or are they scared 
      of her?_" 
*  **Help her learn how to assert herself, stand up for herself while respecting 
   the rights of others.** 'Good girls' aren't nice all the time. 
*  Bite your tongue and let her talk. Listening will give her the space to open 
   up and share with you. 
*  Frenemies - they should expect that their friends will generally be kind. 
   If not, they aren't really friends. 
*  "_At the neurological level, teenagers, more than adults or children, 
   experience social acceptance as highly rewarding._" 
*  **Give your daughter a way out of inappropriate or awkward peer pressure 
   situations by being their scapegoat.** They can avoid risky behavior while 
   staying in good graces with their friends by blaming their parents "crazy 
   rules" for not giving in. "I want to smoke with you, but my mom has a nose 
   like a bloodhound." **Allow your daughter to blame her good behavior on you.** 
*  Arrange a code for your daughter to help her get out of situations. If she 
   calls and says "I forgot to turn off my flatiron" the parents know she wants 
   to be rescued and they start yelling into the phone. The girl can hold the 
   phone away from her ear, make faces, and blame her parents for having to go 
   home. Save face. 
*  **"_Teens aren't addicted to social media. They're addicted to each other._"** 
   Just like we were on the phone as teens, these days it's social media. 
*  "_New research finds that, when it comes to teens' social lives, what happens 
   online reflects what happens in real life. Girls who enjoy happy, supportive 
   friendships in real life use their digital communications to build those 
   friendships, and girls who are having trouble getting along in person also 
   have trouble getting along online._" 
*  "_Make it clear that rules for virtual social behavior are the same as rules 
   for social behavior in the real world: she doesn't have to like everybody, 
   but she should never conduct herself in ways that are less than polite._" 
*  **IMPORTANT:** "_Three conditions regarding your daughter's social life that 
   should cause you to worry: if your daughter has no tribe, if your daughter 
   is a victim of bullying, or if your daughter bullies her peers._" 
*  Point out the critical role that bystanders play in helping victims. 

## Harnessing Emotions ##

*  Emotions. **"_The brain remodels dramatically during the teenage years._"** 
   *  "_Teens' amygdala's reacted strongly to fearful or happy faces...emotional 
      input rings like a gong for teenagers and a chime for everyone else._" 
*  "_If your teenage daughter is developing normally, you are living with someone 
   who secretly worries that she is crazy and who might have the psychological 
   assessment of a psychotic adult._" 
*  **Rorschach tests for teens look the same as those for mentally ill (crazy) 
   people.** 
*  Empathy: "_Your daughter works hard every day to harness powerful and 
   unpredictable emotions so that she can get on with doing everything else she 
   means to do._" 
*  Externalization: when your daughter wants to get rid of an uncomfortable 
   feeling, she will give it away to someone else and who would she trust more 
   than someone who loves her as much as her parents. "_When they externalize, 
   they want you to accept ownership of the offending feeling and will prevent 
   you from giving it back._" 
*  **What to do when your daughter externalizes to you. Avoid taking urgent 
   action or overreacting.** "_Our overreactions only seen to confirm that it 
   really is that bad and usually make the situation worse._" 
*  Teach them to embrace their feelings. "_When I find myself with a girl who 
   is shaken by a feeling she doesn't understand, I start by reassuring her 
   that mental health is like physical health: mentally healthy people get 
   upset, just like physically healthy people get sick. We only worry when a 
   person can't recover._" 
*  Be aware of how they handle feelings. "_Girls can seem to be putzing around 
   when, in fact, they are using effective tactics for helping themselves feel 
   better. Tune in to how your daughter gets a handle on her feelings&mdash;the 
   approach will be entirely her own&mdash;and suggest or support her strategies 
   when she needs them._" 
*  Be aware of how they might use digital technology to manage painful feelings. 
   "_I've seen girls turn to their phones every time they feel lonely. Rather 
   than wondering about the reasons for their loneliness or making plans to 
   get together with a potential friend, they search online for an instant 
   connection or at least an immediate distraction from their isolation._" 
*  **When to worry:** "_So long as your daughter's feelings are all over the 
   map, she's probably doing fine. You should worry if your daughter's mood 
   inconsistently somber or crabby, goes to frightening extremes, is dominated 
   by anxiety, or if she uses self-destructive measures to cope with her 
   feelings._" 
*  The symptoms of depression in teens are usually different from those in 
   adults. "_Instead of being sad and gloomy, depressed teens are more likely 
   to be highly irritable with most people, most of the time. Living with a 
   teenager who suffers from depression is like living with a touchy porcupine._" 
*  **"_It's normal for girls to be temperamental, but they shouldn't be so out 
   of sorts that they offend every adult, can't plan for the future, won't pursue 
   romantic relationships, or don't care for themselves._"** 

## Contending with Adult Authority ##

*  Around age 11, girls begin to develop the ability for abstract reasoning. 
*  **When she has a rude or provocative tone, ask her to communicate her dissent 
   in a more mature way.** It's her right to disagree with you, and it's your 
   right to expect that she be civil while doing so. 
*  "_Emotional intelligence requires the collaboration of the two areas of the 
   brain...(the limbic system) which processes emotional information and 
   generates emotional reactions, and...(the cortex), where rational thinking 
   lives. When we feel threatened or when our feelings are running high, the 
   limbic system can take over and send us into an attacking or defensively 
   protecting mode. This is especially true for teenagers whose brains, as we 
   know, are in the middle of a renovation project that upgrades the limbic 
   system before bringing the higher-order, rational system fully online._" 
*  Communicating with your daughter and tuning in to her emotional intelligence 
   lets "_her know that she deserves to be in relationships with people who are 
   interested in her perspective, can reflect on their own, and are willing to 
   do the hard, humble work of using conflict to deepen and improve a connection._" 
*  **Apologize to your daughter if/when you are provoked into saying something 
   you didn't mean.** 
*  Admit to and own your crazy spots. "_Teens generally have more respect for 
   adults who admit what they as adolescents can plainly see._" This allows 
   them to let go of the dream that you're the perfect parent and the energy 
   they had devoted to "_being angry with you, feeling hurt by you, or trying 
   to change you._" 
*  Regarding teachers: "_There will be no place on your high school transcript 
   to explain that you didn't like [teacher's name]. You'd better figure out 
   how to manage._" 
*  Regarding piercings, hair color, makeup, and the like that you don't agree 
   with, don't stand between them and the natural consequences of their 
   choices, but point them out. Someone might not hire you, treat you 
   differently, or any number of things. 
*  **When to worry:** "_When it comes to the issue of contending with adult 
   authority, three scenarios are grounds for concern: when your teenager never 
   rubs an adult the wrong way, when your teen rubs most adults the wrong way, 
   and when key authority figures work against each other._" 
*  **Too good to be true:** "_It's healthy for teenage girls to find a way to 
   buck authority&mdash;even as they meet or exceed adult standards&mdash;and 
   we should worry about girls who never oppose adults._" 
*  **"_Research suggests that parents who hold negative stereotypes about the 
   teenage years can actually create a self-fulfilling prophecy with their 
   own children._"** 
*  "_Put simply, teenagers live up to expectations, and they live down to 
   them, too._" 

## Planning for the Future ##

*  **Impulses and the internet.** "_Teenagers are and always have been 
   impulsive. And really great teenagers do really dumb things. Unfortunately, 
   digital technology makes it possible for teenagers to act on their impulses 
   in ways that are immediate, public, and permanent._" 
*  Be honest with your daughter and let her know you'll be checking her digital 
   activity. "_First, knowing that you'll be checking not only gives your 
   daughter an important speed bump, it provides her with a convenient excuse 
   for bowing out of some digital naughtiness.... Second, if you come across 
   troublesome content while secretly monitoring your daughter's use, you're 
   stuck. You can't confront your daughter without owning up to your sly 
   behavior, and you may fear that if you admit to your snooping, you'll miss 
   out on future valuable information._" 
*  **"_The best predictor of future behavior is always, always, past behavior. 
   If you want to know what someone is going to do, look at what she has done. 
   If your daughter has handled technology well and hardly needed monitoring, 
   you're probably safe to let her proceed into adolescence with minimal 
   supervision and perhaps a simple warning that you'll revisit your loosened 
   policy if news of any digital naughtiness comes your way._"** 
*  Tying privileges, such as their social life, to grades makes sense because 
   it's how life works beyond the home. "_When people are irresponsible (doing 
   shoddy work, not paying speeding tickets) they tend to lose privileges 
   (professional autonomy, their right to drive)._" 
*  Some levels of anxiety aren't necessarily bad. It's our body and mind 
   signaling us to be prepared for something (like a test or sporting event). 
*  Take tests, give speeches, practice singing in areas/places that are 
   physically similar to where they'll do the activity. It's proven to help 
   improve performance. 
*  "_A test only measures her mastery of the material on the day of assessment. 
   It does not reflect her value as a girl, daughter, or person. It doesn't 
   even measure her promise in the subject being tested._" 
*  "_Girls are more likely to explain failures in terms of internal, permanent 
   factors: she's broken and can't be fixed.... Worst of all, girls' 
   explanations for failure take them out of the game. Once a girl decides 
   that she's weak in a subject, it doesn't matter if she's smart or talented; 
   she's likely to stop trying to build her skills and thus surrenders her 
   chance at success._" 
*  **Emphasize a growth mindset.** Teaches girls to "_**embrace challenges** because 
they know that hard work will expand their skills, welcome feedback from teachers 
and coaches because it provides information about where they need to aim their 
efforts, and feel inspired by talented peers._" 
*  **When it comes to dealing with more talented peers, "_focus on helping your 
   daughter be her best, not the best._"** 
*  **When to worry:**  "_if a girl is so fixated on her future plans that she 
   can't enjoy herself at all, or if a girl is so indifferent to planning that 
   she's closing all sorts of doors._" 

## Entering the Romantic World ##

*  Help your daughter "_come to know what she's hoping for, how to pursue it 
   when ready, and how to make clear what she doesn't want._" 
*  "_Psychologists Jennifer Connolly and Adele Goldberg of York University have 
   pointed out the irony that young crushes change how girls interact with other 
   girls long before they have much impact on how girls interact with boys._" 
*  Researchers "_agree that girls can easily lose sight of their own romantic 
   interests because our culture dictates crazy terms to them. Through magazines, 
   songs, videos, and online content, the popular media tells girls that they 
   should be sexy, but they shouldn't be slutty; that being a prude is bad, but 
   so is having sexual desires; and that having romantic or sexual connections 
   to boys makes a girl cool, but it also exposes her to accusations that she 
   is needy, striving, stupid, or all of the above. Girls become so perplexed 
   by the funhouse mirror image of female sexuality that they can't even begin 
   to reflect on what they want for themselves._" 
*  **Talk with your daughter about how our culture views women and how "_the girls' 
   wishes are left out of media messages and encourage her to take a critical, 
   if not robustly skeptical, view of what drives sexist media content._"** 
*  Sexting requests from boys. It's usually a subset of boys in the 7th and 8th 
   grades. It's a win win for the boys because they either get what they asked 
   for or, if denied, they get proof of their machismo to pass around. 
*  Teach girls to use their inner compass to decide what they do or don't 
   desire (romantically, sexually). "_Once they've done that, they should feel 
   empowered to express their wishes to their partners._" 
*  **Parents have three important jobs in helping a girl to know her inner compass:** 
   "_to alert your daughter to the fact that she has an inner compass, to support 
   her in asking for what she wants, and to make sure she knows how to express 
   what she doesn't want._" 
*  "_As one especially wise mother of three teenagers once told me, 'The best 
   conversations I've ever had with my kids always started when I said, 'Wow, 
   that's a really complicated situation. I don't know what to say. What do 
   you think?''_" 
*  "_Studies consistently find elevated alcohol and drug use among LGBTQ teens 
   who may turn to substances to manage the hardship of being a sexual minority. 
   Yet research also finds that parental acceptance reduces stress for LGBTQ 
   teens and, accordingly, reduces drug use, depression, and suicidal thoughts 
   and actions, while increasing self-esteem._" 
*  **When to worry:**  "_girls whose capacity to attract romantic or sexual 
   attention is the only tributary feeding their lake._" Where the lake represents 
   the girls feelings of self-worth and the tributaries are the ways in which 
   self-worth is created and reinforced. 
*  **When to worry:** "_Studies find that, compared to girls who are dating 
   age-mates, **girls who date boys two or more years older have sex at younger 
   ages, are more likely to contract a sexually transmitted infection, and are 
   less likely to use condoms or other forms of contraception.** Further, dating 
   older guys increases the chances that a girl will use drugs and show signs 
   of depression._" Older kids tend to do riskier things. 

## Caring for Herself ##

*  **Girls stop listening when we lecture.** 
*  **Don't label foods as good or bad**, which can make "bad" foods alluring. Even 
   the words healthy and unhealthy can have the same effect. She recommends 
   using the method used on "_Sesame Street, who describe foods as being 
   'anytime foods' or 'sometime foods.'_" 
*  **"_Food [and diet] is one of the many domains where you'll want to frame 
   your daughter's choices in terms of the care she takes of herself, not in 
   terms of the rules you are telling her to follow._"** 
*  "_Digital technology should never find its way into anyone's need, and 
   everyone in the family should step away from his or her devices at least a 
   half hour before trying to go to sleep._" 
*  **To help with better sleep, have her do her homework anywhere but her bed.** 
*  Promote healthy sleep habits! 
*  Alcohol use: "_Because the adolescent brain reacts to alcohol and drugs 
   differently than the adult brain does, teenage substance use can shape 
   what the brain deems pleasurable and lay the groundwork for addiction._" 
*  **Advise them about good judgment and alcohol.** "_'Consider a situation 
   with the following variables: you go to a party, your friends ditch you, 
   and there are some guys at the party who seem creepy. To that equation, 
   let's add one more variable: whether you are totally sober or whether 
   you've had a few drinks.' From there, girls can readily imagine any number 
   of scenarios if they've been drinking. And they can strategize about how 
   they would keep themselves are if they were sober._" 
*  Just holding a beer and nursing it all night long is a good tactic for 
   avoiding over consumption. 
*  "_When it comes to talking with your daughter about drugs, play the role 
   of the dispassionate purveyor of reliable information and let the facts 
   about illegal substances do all the work for you. Trust me, they are 
   terrifying enough._" 
*  "_Studies show that, like alcohol, marijuana is toxic to the maturing 
   adolescent brain._" 
*  **A short list of risks associated with having sex for teens to consider:** 
   "_unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, a misunderstanding 
   about what sex means to each partner, and the potential for the encounter 
   to go past the point of consent._" 
*  Words for your daughter about sex: "_The age at which you have sex and the 
   nature of the relationship isn't what matters most to us; our expectation 
   is that you won't have sex until you are responsible enough to work with 
   your partner to make sure nothing goes wrong._"
