[![The Raksura series, by Martha Wells](/images/cover_TheCloudRoads_MarthaWells_150.jpg "The Raksura series, by Martha Wells"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597802161)

From the same author who brought us a sarcastic, self-aware security robot in **Murderbot**
(see my [top reads from 2020](/reads/top-reads-2020/)), we have the fantastical
**Books of the Raksura**. The Raksura are a shape-shifting race, often confused with the
Fell, another shape-shifting race with a much different culture. Wells has built a completely
new world for us to enjoy; one with depth and expansiveness in its geography, societies,
cultures, and peoples. I use the word _peoples_ generically, because Wells doesn't include
humans in the lineup. It's refreshing to approach the main characters without the broad
assumptions we often apply to humans when they're the center of a fantasy world. As
with **Murderbot**, the **Books of the Raksura** are entertaining stories with character
arcs that allow the reader to experience their growth and development. The series, in my
recommended reading order:

1.  [The Cloud Roads](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597802161) (Book 1)
1.  [The Serpent Sea](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781949102291) (Book 2)
1.  [The Siren Depths](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781949102307) (Book 3)
1.  [The Falling World & The Tale of Indigo and Cloud](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597805353) (Stories, Vol. 1)
1.  [The Dead City & The Dark Earth Below](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H519XJV/) (Stories, Vol. 2)
1.  [The Edge of the Worlds](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597808972) (Book 4)
1.  [The Harbors of the Sun](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597809337) (Book 5)

[![The Monstress series, by Marjorie Liu & Sana Takeda](/images/cover_MonstressAwakening_MarjorieLiu&SanaTakeda_150.jpg "The Monstress series, by Marjorie Liu & Sana Takeda"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781632157096)

With the Monstress series, Marjorie Liu & Sana Takeda have created a wondrous and dark world
for us to experience. In the midst of war, they explore friendships, connections to family,
genocide, racism, slavery, and so much more. Even though the topics are often dark, their
expansiveness imagination is a joy to behold in the story and art. The series so far:

1.  [Awakening (Vol. 1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781632157096)
1.  [Haven (Vol. 2)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534300415)
1.  [The Blood (Vol. 3)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534306912)
1.  [The Chosen (Vol. 4)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534313361)
1.  [Warchild (Vol. 5)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534316614)
1.  [The Vow (Vol. 6)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534319158)

You’ll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey, by Amber Ruffin & Lacey Lamar

Who knew that a sarcastic, self-aware security robot on a journey of discovery would be what I
needed during a world pandemic. It was. This series of mostly novella-length books is funny,
sardonic, packed with action, and even some self-reflection (from the perspective of a
security bot questioning its purpose in life). The Murderbot Diaries were exactly the humor I
needed to get through the end of 2020. The series so far:

1.  [The Calculating Stars](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780765378385) (Book 1)
1.  [The Fated Sky](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780765398949) (Book 2)
1.  [The Relentless Moon](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250236968) (Book 3)
