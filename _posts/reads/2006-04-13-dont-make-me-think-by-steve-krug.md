I especially like this book because it is exactly what it claims to be: 
a relatively short, easy to read book about web usability. In fact, the 
author explicitly states that he "worked hard to keep this book short &ndash; 
hopefully short enough you can read it on a long plane ride." Being a 
very busy person at work and home I really, really appreciate this!

I highly recommend this book for: _anyone who is the slightest bit 
involved in developing or designing a web site’s user interface…__period__._ 
The reason I say this is because:

* it’s a great starting point for someone who has no experience with 
web site usability. 
* it seems like a great [and quick] refresher for anyone who does have 
usability experience. 
* it’s an interesting read because the author’s character really comes 
through [versus being dry and boring]. 
* it really is short enough for a long plane ride or a few nights 'bedtime reading.'

A few highlights of things I learned and/or appreciated:

* First and foremost, don’t make your users think! For example, descriptions 
[for categories, products, lists, etc.] should be clear and concise. 
* Users really don’t read web pages, they just scan them for keywords.
* Users _[satisfice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing)_ when 
selecting where to go next on any given page. This basically means we tend 
to choose the first reasonable option instead of examining all of them before 
selecting one. And yes, I realized that I do this. 
* Following conventions is a good thing. Forget about reinventing the wheel 
and just use techniques and design patterns that people are already 
comfortable with.
* Keep the visual noise to a minimum [don’t try to cram in everything and 
the kitchen sink]. 
* Omit needless words. Get rid of half of the words on every single page. 
When you’re done with that…do it again. It may sound harsh, but it’s true. 
* The "You Are Here" theory. Make it blatantly obvious where you are in the 
site structure at all times [using page titles, highlighting, home link, 
tabs, etc.]. 
* Always have a search box…unless your site is a single static .htm page. 
* Keep the home page simple! Remember, it’s purpose is simply to get across 
the big picture. 
* Usability testing doesn’t have to be hard, in fact, it can be down right 
simple. Just grab your neighbor for 15 minutes. 
* Usability tests…small scope frequent testing is better than a single (or 
few) large scope test(s). 
* "The Reservoir of Goodwill" – Don’t use it all up and try to refill it 
when you do use some! 
* Last, but certainly not least. Always keep accessibility in mind when 
designing. Steve is referring to [Section 508 of the 1988 Amendments to 
the Rehabilitation Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508), which 
specifies accessibility standards for information technology (like web 
sites).
