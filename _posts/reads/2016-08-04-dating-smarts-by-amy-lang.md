If you're a parent to a pre-teen or teenager, buy this book. Read it. 
Have your child read it. Discuss it with them. Openly.

If you're an aunt, uncle, grandparent, brother, sister, cousin, or close 
friend to someone with a pre-teen or teenager, buy this book for them.

I bought this for my middle school daughter to read, hoping to prepare 
her for dating (soon to begin, I'm sure). Anticipating open discussions 
with her, I read the book first.

I'd break down this book into two sections: relationships and sex.

## 1. Relationships ##

I wish I had had the section on relationships available to me when I was a 
teenager in the 80's. Even if I hadn't followed all of the suggestions, at 
least I would have known how unrealistic my expectations were. 

Lang does a great job of talking to the reader in a comfortable manner about 
how to know if you're ready to date, determining what's important to you in 
a relationship, and simple ways to stand up for yourself when those things 
aren't present.

Honestly, I know several adults who would benefit from reading this book.

## 2. Sex ##

57 out of 1,000 teenage girls become pregnant in the U.S each year. In Holland, 
the statistic is 5 out of 1,000. That's a pretty big difference.

> 1 in 4 teenage girls in the U.S. has a sexually transmitted infection (STI). 

That's absolutely crazy; 25% of woman get a STI before the age of 20.

We have so many safe means of preventing pregnancy and STIs, yet we are horrible 
at communicating about these to our teenagers. Assuming that abstinence isn't 
your only option (proven to not work, by the way), Lang does a wonderful job of 
discussing the other options.

She also provides many helpful suggestions and even scripts for handling the 
common, yet tricky, scenarios that teenagers often find themselves in 
while exploring their sexuality.

I recommend this book for both parents and their teens. Lang writes in an 
easy, conversational tone which should be accessible to young teens. She 
brings up all the topics parents might be afraid to, opening the door for 
conversations that might be uncomfortable, but are necessary to help your 
child have healthy romantic relationships.
