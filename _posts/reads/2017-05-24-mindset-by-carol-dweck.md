What's more important, talent or practice? 

I posed this question to my daughter several years ago and, at 9 years old, 
her first response was _talent_. She already understood by participating 
in sports, dance, school, and other activities that innate talent can get 
you pretty far. She had yet to grasp that _practice_ and _dedication_ are 
what turn a _good_ player/student/whatever into a **_great_** one. That was 
when I knew, as a parent, I need to emphasize practice and the growth mindset.

> The _growth mindset_ is based on the belief that your basic qualities are 
  things you can cultivate through your efforts.

Dr. Carol Dweck describes her research and experience with interesting examples 
and understandable explanations. The first three chapters define the terms and 
explain their meanings for laypeople. Dweck then discusses the fixed-minded 
versus growth-minded actions of people in the world of sports, business, 
education, and personal relationships. She wraps up with a chapter focusing on 
how to change mindsets.

At the end of each chapter, Dweck provides a summary of helpful hints for how 
to create a growth mindset, both in yourself and those around you. Pay close 
attention to these, take some notes, and make reminders to revisit these every 
once in awhile. They help us recognize our own fixed mindset when we encounter 
it and provide definitive action to move past it.

> Even geniuses have to work hard for their achievements.

## Parenting with the growth mindset

One of my main goals is to teach my daughter that she can do anything, and 
most things require dedication and effort. Sometimes the effort 
required will be more than we want to put forth or simply not worth the time 
invested. Those are the moments we should say to ourselves 
"I could spend the time and effort to learn [this], but I'm choosing not to for 
[various reasons]." And that's OK. 

Meanwhile, the things we want to learn are worth the time and dedication to learn 
thoroughly. This will mean pushing through frustration, anger, doubt, and many 
more emotional obstacles. Not to mention the tangible ones, like only having so 
much time in the day and balancing it with our other interests and 
responsibilities. 

Dr. Dweck does a wonderful job of discussing what makes up the growth mindset, how 
it contrasts to a fixed mindset, examples of both, and suggestions for getting our 
children (and ourselves) into the growth mindset.

## Responding to failure

Responding to failure is difficult for everyone, especially children who've been 
shielded from it. It's easy to throw up your hands in frustration and claim "I 
can't do this!" At that point, someone in the fixed mindset will quit because it's 
too difficult or challenging.

As part of a study, college freshman were observed for a semester in a chemistry 
class known for being particularly difficult. Students with the fixed mindset were 
found to blame others for their poor performance instead of acknowledging that 
they did poorly, holding themselves accountable, and being determined to improve.

Whereas, students with the growth mindset took charge of their learning and 
maintained their motivation. Instead of rote memorization of the material, they 
would look for themes and underlying principles, and go over mistakes until they 
understood them. They were studying to learn, not just ace a test.

> In the fixed mindset, everything is about the outcome. If you fail&mdash;or if 
  you're not the best&mdash;it's all been wasted. The growth mindset allows people 
  to value what they're doing _regardless of the outcome_. They're tackling 
  problems, charting new courses, working on important issues. Maybe they haven't 
  found the cure for cancer, but the search was deeply meaningful.

## Adults matter

Children look to the adults around them for examples of how to navigate life. It 
can be hilariously sobering, or even sad in some cases, to see your own behaviors 
echoed back to you by a young human.

My teenage daughter ends 50% of her requests with _real quick_. "Will you look at 
my homework, _real quick_?" "Can we run to the store for a doomafligget, _real 
quick_?" "Will you feed the dogs for me, _real quick_?" After hearing it for the 
thousandth time, I realized that she's echoing my own phrase right back to me. I 
had no idea how often I said it, nor how annoying it was to hear so frequently. 
D'oh!

The same theory applies to our behaviors. When we act using the growth mindset, 
instead of a fixed one, it reinforces that behavior for them.

> As parents, teachers, and coaches, we are entrusted with people's lives. They 
  are our responsibility and our legacy. We now know that the growth mindset has a 
  key role to play in helping _us_ fulfill our mission and in helping _them_ 
  fulfill their potential.

When dealing with low and high performers, Dweck refers to studies that found 
teachers who believed in and practiced the growth mindset were able to help 
students improve throughout the year regardless of their performance designation. 
In fact, the teachers were able to move the low performers into the high performing 
group because they had found a way to reach the "low-ability" students.

Kids will also look to celebrities for examples of success, there's no way around 
it. I can remember being in awe of Magic Johnson as I watched him play basketball 
on our 19" color television in the 1980's. Kids might watch their heroes on 
YouTube or Netflix these days, but we can guide them towards the ones who 
exemplify the growth mindset. The author describes several sports stars who 
embrace the growth mindset and we can find more by looking for the same 
characteristics.

 > All of these people had character. None of them thought they were special 
   people, born with the right to win. They were people who worked hard, who 
   learned how to keep their focus under pressure, and who stretched beyond their 
   ordinary abilities when they had to."

## Bullying defused

A group of eighth grade students were presented with the following bullying 
scenario and asked to imagine it was happening to them.

> It is a new school year and things seem to be going pretty well. Suddenly some 
  popular kids start teasing you and calling you names. At first you brush it 
  off&mdash;these things happen. But it continues. Every day they follow you, they 
  taunt you, they make fun of what you're wearing, they make fun of what you look 
  like, they tell you you're a loser&mdash;in front of everybody. Every day.

The students with a fixed mindset expressed a desire for revenge and took the 
incident more personally. The harassment made them feel like they were a nobody, 
stupid, weird, or a misfit.

Meanwhile, the growth-mindset kids didn't see the bullying as a reflection of who 
they were. Instead, they saw it as a psychological problem of the bullies, "a way 
for the bullies to gain status or charge their self-esteem." The growth-mindset 
eighth graders also expressed the desire for eventual forgiveness instead of 
revenge; they felt sympathy for the bullies.

## Social skills

As an introvert, I understand the pressure and stress created by social situations 
that require chit-chat and interacting with others, especially strangers. It's 
easy to decline invitations in order to avoid the awkwardness or fears of being 
judged. With the growth mindset, we view these as skills that can be improved 
rather than characteristics of an introvert that are set in stone.

Coffee with an acquaintance (Seattle teens actually drink coffee-like mochas 
and lattes), a friend's after-school party, or an extracurricular club for 
something they enjoy are great opportunities to practice their social skills. 
Dinner at home is a safe place to practice conversational skills as well as table 
manners.

> "Are you shy?" Remember that "social skills are things you can improve and 
  social interactions [can be] for learning and enjoyment, not judgment. Keep 
  practicing this."

## Tips for helping kids become growth minded

The book contains several suggestions and tips. Here are some that I found 
particularly interesting or helpful.

> The fixed mindset can undo our love of learning. The next time you're enjoying 
  something and it becomes hard, "picture your brain forming new connections as 
  you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going."

> Seek constructive criticism.

> If there's something in your past that you think measured you, especially as a 
  failure, focus on that thing and feel all the emotions that go with it. Put a 
  growth mindset on it by asking yourself: "What did I (or can I) learn from that 
  experience? How can I use it as a basis for growth?"

> Think of the worst rejection you've ever had. Get in touch with all the feelings,
  and see if you can view it from a growth mindset. What did you learn from it? 
  Did it teach you something about what you want and don't want in your life? Did 
  it teach you some positive things that were useful in later relationships? Can 
  you forgive that person and wish them well? Can you let go of the bitterness?

Issues arise in every relationship, romantic or otherwise:

> Try to see them from a growth mindset: Problems can be a vehicle for developing 
  greater understanding and intimacy. Allow [them] to air his or her differences, 
  listen carefully, and discuss them in a patient and caring manner. You may be 
  surprised at the closeness this creates.

> Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time.

When sending messages about process and growth, praise children for using a 
"growth-oriented process&mdash;what they accomplished through practice, study, 
persistence, and good strategies." Dr. Dweck provides several examples of these 
statements.

> I like the way you tried all kinds of strategies on that math problem until 
  you finally got it. You thought of a lot of different ways to do it and found 
  the one that worked.
	
> That picture has so many beautiful colors. Tell me about them.

She also provides examples of responses where students worked hard and didn't do 
well.
	
> I liked the effort you put in, but let's work together some more and figure 
  out what it is you don't understand.
	
> Everyone learns in a different way. Let's keep trying to find the way that 
  works for you.
	
Live the growth mindset instead of simply teaching it. Create several 
growth-mindset questions for dinner conversation with your family.

* What did you learn today? 
* What mistake did you make that taught you something? 
* What did you try hard at today? 

Beyond school or sports, encourage kids to talk about "ways they learned to make 
friends, or ways they're learning to understand and help others. You want to 
communicate that feats of intellect or physical prowess are not all you care 
about."

[depicts the differences between growth and fixed mindsets](http://www.nigelholmes.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/two_mindsets.png) 
and hang it by your bathroom mirror or somewhere you'll see it every day. 
Ask yourself each morning "What are the opportunities for learning and growth 
today? For myself? For the people around me?"

I thoroughly enjoyed reading **Mindset: The New Psychology of Success** by Dr. 
Carol S. Dweck. Although I focused on parenting and children in my notes, the 
chapters on business, sports, and relationships held many pertinent observations 
and suggestions. It's well worth the read&mdash;likely to put you into the growth 
mindset and expand your possibilities.

Remember: practice, practice, practice (smartly)!

> New research shows that the brain is more like a muscle&mdash;it changes and 
  gets stronger when you use it.
