[John Richard Stephens](http://johnrichardstephens.com/) does his best to tie 
together the real story of the [gunfight at OK Corral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral) 
and its participants with information from several disparate sources. While 
the events are interesting, unfortunately, it feels disjointed in its delivery. 
Perhaps I'm jaded by Hollywood's popular renditions of the gun slinging hero.

It's an interesting collection of articles and letters written by 
[Wyatt Earp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Earp), 
along with several articles and interviews of the man by others. The author 
clearly denotes the few that are from questionable sources, describing why 
they lack credibility. He includes them to provide a sense of the publicity 
that Earp had to live with for the rest of his life after the famous gunfight. 
Stephens has clearly done his homework and put a lot of effort towards telling 
the truth of what happened.

The author includes letters by and interviews with a few notable compatriots 
of Wyatt's: [Doc Holliday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Holliday), 
[Bat Masterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_Masterson), and even an 
elderly woman claiming to have been [Big Nose Kate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Nose_Kate) 
40 years later. They're all entertaining.

There are pictures of Wyatt and the others throughout the book. It was a nice 
touch, giving us faces to go with the names.

Worth noting, my hardback edition was missing pages 96-160. I turned page 95 
only to land on page 33 for the second time. Pages 33-95 were printed in two 
sections, back to back, and then I had to start at page 161. My copy was 
printed by Fall River Press of Sterling Publishing in 2015.
