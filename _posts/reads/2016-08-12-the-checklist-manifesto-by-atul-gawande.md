> It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment. It 
runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among 
us&mdash;those we aspire to be&mdash;handle situations of high stakes and 
complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise. They do not have 
protocols and checklists.

Gawande does an excellent job of arguing the opposite. While checklists 
cannot be living, breathing heroes, they can be the means by which any 
person (or team of people) attains the status. As he says, 

> ...maybe our idea of heroism needs updating.

Checklists "are not comprehensive how-to guidesâ€¦. They are quick and 
simple tools aimed to buttress the skills of expert professionals."

I appreciate Gawande's perspective and the ease with which he communicates 
the benefits of checklists. He succinctly explains how checklists enhance 
the process by which intelligent people apply their knowledge and experience. 
They do not replace the people themselves or their intellectual capacity 
to make decisions. The checklists operate as a reminder to complete a small 
set of select important items or communications.

Gawande provides examples of how simple checklists have improved the 
processes (as measured through quantifiable results) in several different 
fields, from medical to construction to financial investment. Reading 
through the examples gave me several ideas for how to incorporate 
checklists into my own work.

Remember, checklists don't replace knowledge or experience.
