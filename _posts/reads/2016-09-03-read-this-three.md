Currently in the middle of a career shift, I picked up this book looking to find some encouragement and inspiration in dealing with the changes. While this was plentiful, what struck me the most was how it made me look at my hobbies and other interests with a different perspective.

I found myself filled with energy and ideas while reading Dream Year. The blank pages in the back are brimming with my notes about various "dream" projects. In fact, they spilled over into my brainstorming journal. Arment's suggestions would inspire my mind so much that I stopped reading it before bed, my brain racing in so many different directions, feeling too excited and unable to roll over to sleep.

Having said that, I think this book will only have that effect if the reader is in a place where they're open minded, curious, and already filled with ideas. He presents hundreds of ideas as examples and ways to create a program for success, but it is not a prescriptive step-by-step set of instructions for the reader to follow. I presume that would come with the Dream Year coaching service provided outside of the book.
