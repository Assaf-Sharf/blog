##### The abstract

REST is nowadays the most popular architecture for building Web services. However, data produced by REST Web services
assume their consumers have prior knowledge of their structure and meaning.

JSON-LD is a lightweight data format that can be used to provide easily accessible context in a backwards-compatible way.

In this talk, we will discuss the options of using JSON-LD to enhance REST Web service output with contextual information
without requiring significant development costs on either server and client side.
