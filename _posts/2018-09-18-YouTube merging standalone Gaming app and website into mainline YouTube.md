<p><p>YouTube's foray into a dedicated video game livestreaming service will be folding into its main service over the next year. It will be fully discontinued in March of 2019.</p>
<p>As announced in <a href="https://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/09/gaming-gets-new-home-on-youtube.html" rel="nofollow">a YouTube Blog post</a> by Christina Chen, YouTube's Director of Product Management, the YouTube Gaming app and website will be supplanted by a new dedicated gaming page on <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/youtube/'><img alt='Small YouTube icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/youtube_115696.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />YouTube</a>'s main site and apps. This is due to the fact that, according to Chen, &quot;the amount of gamers we are able to reach is far bigger on YouTube [than on YouTube Gaming].&quot;</p>
<p>Currently, the standalone site that launched in 2015, <a href='https://gaming.youtube.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://gaming.youtube.com/ </a>, will coexist with the new <a href='https://www.youtube.com/gaming' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/gaming </a>, though the former will be phased out over the next year as it is no longer actively maintained. By the end of March of 2019, the standalone <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/youtube-gaming/'><img alt='Small YouTube Gaming icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/youtube-gaming_79716.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />YouTube Gaming</a> website and apps will be shut down.</p>
