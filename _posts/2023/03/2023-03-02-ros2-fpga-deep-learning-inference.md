Concerning the previous post ["Cognition: distributed data processing system for lunar activities"](../../project/lunar-rover-ros-fpga/), we are happy to announce that our repository has been made public. It contains a ROS2 application that allows running inference on FPGA using Xilinx Vitis AI Library. In addition, it contains our developing notes and a tutorial on how we configure the VCK190 developer kit.
