On the last three days, we had the pleasure of participating in the [PP-RAI'2023](https://pp-rai.pl/) conference at the Łódź University of Technology. Its agenda covered keynote lectures, networking, and poster sessions. The event is a great opportunity to exchange knowledge and experience in the field of artificial intelligence.

During the conference, we prepared and presented two scientific papers:

* "Spotting advertisements from above: billboard detection and segmentation in UAV imagery" by Bartosz Ptak, Jan Dominiak, Marek Kraft
