In this post, I will be taking note of Chris Voss's
[Master Class](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation/).
I will do my best to add each lecture here.
As you might notice I did not start note taking this
[Lecture 3, Labeling]({{site.url}}/{{page.url}}/#labeling).
The purpose of these notes are mainly personal, I would like to
be able to look at them and remember some key lessons that I learned.
If you are also going through the series, feel free to use them as
a template and add more content.

# Empathy
- Understanding the rules that the other team is playing by
- You don't need to agree with those rules but you have to grasp them
- Understand them and play by those rules.
- Play their game


# Mirroring
-  Let people talk
-  Pick the last 1-3 words and say them back to the person, phrased as a question
-  People want to be heard, keep asking them questions about what they are saying and they will start to think they are part of the
negotiation.
-  By the end of the questions you ask them, they will be more
open to what you initially said.
-  This is an art which takes lots of practice, don't be discouraged.
Do keep trying. Let people do all the talking, and ask for further
explanation. They will love you for it.


# Labeling
- Amygdala is the emotional center of the brain.
- When showing people pictures that incurred negative emotions,
they were able to see the effect on the amygdala.
- When asking those people to label how they felt after seeing those
negative pictures, they saw that the level of negativity on the
amygdala decreased.
- If you identify a negative emotion someone might be having, such
as feeling angry, and you label it as such, it help the person
reduce that negative emotion.
- A very useful tool with various application, don't be fooled by the simplicity.
- Steps of Labeling:
  1. Being aware of what the other person is feeling.
     1. This is usually easy and your gut will walk you through it.
  2. Simply label:
     - It seems like ...
     - It sounds like ...
     - I don't want you to get upset about this...
     - By labeling something you can establish repore
     with the other person, you can gain insight to what they are
     thinking, and it helps you increase your influence.
       - Trust-based influence:
         - Lowest maintenance and durable type of influence there is.
- Incorrect way to label something
  - What I am hearing is ...
    - Dropped the word "I", meaning that I care more about my
    perspective.
  - Resist the urge to label a good label.
  - Try not to talk after a good label, let it sit on the other side.
  Take the effect that you want it to. Let it sync it.
- Going to take more than one label to defuse the negative.
- Labels will help defuse the negative, but the degree varies.
  - Some labels will hit harder and help you gain more influence than others.
- If you label an emotion and the response you receive is silence,
it doesn't mean that your label isn't good, it means that you just
need more.
  - Label it some more, add some comments.
    - "Sounds like I haven't gone far enough"
    - "Sounds like there's more than meets the eye"
    - "Sounds like there's some feelings about this that I haven't quite touched yet.
- Labeling a negative deactivates a negative, but labeling a positive reinforces it.
  - Telling others you appreciate how generous they are being with
  their time (Customer service).
  - If someone thinks that they're being generous with their time,
  feed that, reinforce that emotion. It will help your influence.
- Mirrors are a great way to dye yourself in with labels.
- A combination of mirrors leading to a label can be very successful.
  - Using several mirrors will help you tease out an emotion
  that the other side might be having, for you to label.
- You can mirror the response to a label, and get a lot more information afterward.
## Exercise
- Labels don't have to be emotions (sad, angry, happy),
they can also be things that someone enjoys.
  - Sounds like you like {puzzles, drama, people}
- You might have some awkward labels, but sometimes people might be
  okay with talking about that.
- The other person can explore a label and how they feel about it.
- The other person feels heard.
- You let the other side say all that they want without knowing a single
thing about you.
- __Not a single question was asked__, mirroring and labeling allow the
other person to keep talking without constantly asking them questions.
