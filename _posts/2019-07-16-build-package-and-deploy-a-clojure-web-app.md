Here are a series of posts I wrote on behalf of CircleCI about
building, packaging and deploying a Clojure web application using
Docker, Terraform and AWS ECS.

[Building a Clojure Web App using
Duct](https://circleci.com/blog/build-a-clojure-web-app-using-duct/)

[Package a Clojure Web Application using
Docker](https://circleci.com/blog/package-a-clojure-web-application-using-docker/)

[Deploy a Clojure Web Application to AWS using
Terraform](https://circleci.com/blog/deploy-a-clojure-web-application-to-aws-using-terraform/)

That last post was also picked up by DZone [here](https://dzone.com/articles/deploy-a-clojure-web-application-to-aws-using-terr)
