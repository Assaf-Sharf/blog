<p><p>Epic Games, the creators of Fortnite and Unreal Tournament, have launched a video game storefront that competes with the likes of Steam, Origin, and others on personal computers.</p>
<p>Epic detailed the launch of the storefront and what it's doing to set itself ahead of the competition in <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/the-epic-games-store-is-now-live" rel="nofollow">a news post on its official website</a>. The main appeal for both developers and consumers is that, instead of the standard 70%/30% revenue split used by dedicated game consoles and other computer game storefronts like <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/steam/'><img alt='Small Steam icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/steam_63652.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Steam</a>, Epic is offering a much better split for developers: game creators get 88% of the revenue made from their games when they're purchased from the <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/epic-games-store/'><img alt='Small Epic Games Store icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/epic-games-store_136420.jpg?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Epic Games Store</a>, while Epic only receives 12%.</p>
<p>Though the launch lineup of games is relatively small, Epic plans on growing the store throughout 2019 and beyond, and is offering big incentives for users to at least install its launcher: a free game will be given away once every two weeks through all of 2019. Once users claim these games during the free period, they own them for the lifetime of the account. This starts with <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/subnautica/'><img alt='Small Subnautica icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/subnautica_99051.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Subnautica</a>, which users can claim to own from December 14th to December 27th, 2018. The second game is <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/super-meat-boy/'><img alt='Small Super Meat Boy icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/super-meat-boy_79943.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Super Meat Boy</a>, which will be free to claim from December 28th, 2018 to January 10th, 2019.</p>
