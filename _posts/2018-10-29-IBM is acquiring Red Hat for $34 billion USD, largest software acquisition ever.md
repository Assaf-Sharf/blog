<p><p>International Business Machines Corporation and Red Hat Incorporated have announced that Red Hat will be acquired for $34 billion United States dollars. This is the largest software acquisition ever made. Before this, Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion USD was the largest software acquisition.</p>

The release also states that this will allow <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/redhat/'><img alt='Small Red Hat icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/redhat_85247.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Red Hat</a> to maintain its commitment to open source development and its unique development culture.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-red-hat-m-a-ibm/ibm-to-acquire-software-company-red-hat-for-34-billion-idUSKCN1N20N3" rel="nofollow">an interview with Reuters</a>, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty states that this acquisition, which is IBM's attempt to compete with <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-cloud-platform/'><img alt='Small Google Cloud Platform icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-cloud-platform_69575.jpg?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Cloud Platform</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-azure/'><img alt='Small Microsoft Azure icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/microsoft-azure_107891.webp?format=png&width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Microsoft Azure</a>, and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/amazon-web-services/'><img alt='Small Amazon Web Services icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/amazon-web-services_28954.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Amazon Web Services</a> in the cloud infrastructure space, is because &quot;Red Hat is one of the very few companies in the cloud computing sector that has both revenue growth and free cash flow.&quot;</p>
<p>Red Hat's current CEO, Jim Whitehurst, will maintain his position with the rest of the management team. He will also become a part of IBM's senior management team reporting to Ginni Rometty directly. There have been no announcements concerning any change in the sponsorship of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/fedora/'><img alt='Small Fedora icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/fedora_82253.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Fedora</a> or other open source projects.</p>
