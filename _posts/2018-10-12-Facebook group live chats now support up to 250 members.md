<p><p>Facebook is now gradually rolling out support for increased sizes for group instant messaging, as well as group audio and video calls.</p>
<p>Starting today, users will be able to participate in live text chats of up to 250 people from a Facebook group. In addition, users can also join in voice and video calls that support up to 50 people simultaneously.</p>
<p>In order to avoid spamming users with chat and call notifications, each user will only be notified the first time they are invited to a chat unless they voluntarily choose otherwise. Support for these larger groups also allows users to only be notified of direct &quot;@&quot; mentions to them specifically.</p>
