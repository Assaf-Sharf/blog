title: Moving blog from Hugo to Jekyll
excerpt: Blog is moving from Hugo to Jekyll

---



This is the last post using Hugo as the engine for this blog. 
New engine will be Jekyll using GitHub pages.
I've already created the scripts to move to Jekyll although I still need solve my image placement [predicament](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42047112/jekyll-include-image-files-next-to-markdown-post-file).

How does affect you the reader?

- The RSS link will probably change from [index.xml](http://sarafian.github.io/index.xml) to [feed.xml](http://sarafian.github.io/feed.xml).
  - I also expect differences in the composition of the file, therefore expect your RSS client to go a bit crazy.
- The look and feel will be different.
- Existing post url will be changed also.
