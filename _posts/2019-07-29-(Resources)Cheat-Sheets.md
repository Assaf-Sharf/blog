excerpt: "A collection of cheat sheets to share knowledge easier"

We’ve collected a lot of knowledge over the years, and in many cases we’ve created our own cheat sheets to make our jobs easier. Here are a few of them:

# [Splunk Data Onboarding](/assets/pdf/onboarding_cheatsheet.pdf)
Mostly for Splunk administrators and consultants, this cheat sheet contains hints for [props.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Propsconf), [the most common date and time format variables](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/Commontimeformatvariables#Date_and_time_variables), some hints on rewriting [default fields](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/Usedefaultfields), using [lookups](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/Addfieldsfromexternaldatasources), and more. Get it [here](/assets/pdf/onboarding_cheatsheet.pdf).

# [Syslog](/assets/pdf/syslog_cheatsheet.pdf)
Need some hints and quick tips for setting up rsyslogd or syslog-ng? Our [syslog cheat sheet](/assets/pdf/syslog_cheatsheet.pdf) has you covered.

# [Splunk AppDev](/assets/pdf/appdev_cheatsheet.pdf)
Building a Splunk app for yourself? Maybe something you want to share on [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/)? Check out the Splunk [AppDev cheat sheet](/assets/pdf/appdev_cheatsheet.pdf) for tips and tricks on making your app successful.

# [Securing Splunk](/assets/pdf/securing-splunk-cheatsheet.pdf)
Want to make sure you are following the [best practices for securing](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Hardeningstandards) your Splunk deployment? Our [Securing Splunk cheat sheet](/assets/pdf/securing-splunk-cheatsheet.pdf) can help guide you along.

# [Splunk Search Head Clustering](/assets/pdf/shc_cheatsheet.pdf)
Setting up [Search Head Clustering](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DistSearch/SHCsystemrequirements) and need a quick-start? Our [Search Head Clustering cheat sheet](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DistSearch/SHCsystemrequirements) can help you get up to speed.

# [Splunk Common Network Ports](/assets/pdf/splunk_common_ports.pdf)
Common network ports when looking for firewall rules. Always remember to check your configs, as Splunk lets you change most of these. Also available as a [PNG](/assets/pdf/splunk_common_ports.pdf).

# [Splunk Props.conf Location (beta)](/assets/pdf/where_to_put_props.pdf)
We get a lot of questions about where a [props.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Propsconf) configuration belongs, so we created this [flow chart](/assets/pdf/where_to_put_props.pdf) to help identify the proper location.

# [Splunk Props.conf Index-time Order](/assets/pdf/props_conf_order.pdf)
When getting new data into Splunk, it helps to be familiar with the index-time pipeline, and how you can use the order of [props.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Propsconf) configs to modify and optimize your data. We created this [cheat sheet](/assets/pdf/props_conf_order.pdf) to help people remember that order.
