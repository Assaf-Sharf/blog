It took me a bit to figure out how to 

Will MathJax render some math?

$$ \phi = - \frac{G M}{r} $$

We can find the gravitational field from the gradient of the potential $\vec{g} = -\vec{\nabla}\phi$.

$$ \vec{g} = \frac{G M}{r^2} \, \hat{r} $$

The force experienced by a gravitational charge $m$ in a field $\vec{g}$ is simply

$$ \vec{F} = m\, \vec{g} $$

here's some more inline math \\(\mathrm{d}s^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2\\)
