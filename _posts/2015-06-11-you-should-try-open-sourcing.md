For those who are not conscious about that, Open Source is the reason of the existence of many development communities. Would you imagine nowadays the iOS/OSX development without Cocoapods? And what about Ruby without its Gems? A lot of developers around the world put their effors to simplify your work publishing their work in an Open Source way through these dependency managers (:clap: for them because otherwise it would be impossible to resolve many dependencies conflicts of our projects). Open Source a project doesn't mean just `git push origin` of your projects and making them public. It has some extra implications that will help you as a developer and with your future projects. Have you ever done it before? Would you like to know how it helped to me? Let's see.

- Tests
- Wiki page
- Code structure
- Code feedback


### Compromise (implement a library that you use in your projects)

### Recommendation
