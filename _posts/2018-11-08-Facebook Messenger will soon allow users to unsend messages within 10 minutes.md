<p><p>A feature present in many instant messaging services today is coming soon to one of the world's most popular services.</p>
<p>Former director of social media for The Next Web Matt Navarra posted the patch notes for version 191 of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/facebook-messenger/'><img alt='Small Facebook Messenger icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/facebook-messenger_40294.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Facebook Messenger</a> for iOS <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1060101306180878336" rel="nofollow">on Twitter</a>. The notes detail that the ability to delete messages sent using the service within ten minutes of being posted is coming soon.</p>
<p>The big caveat here is that the time frame to delete the messages is within 10 minutes of them being sent. This is nearly as strict as the initial 7 minute deletion window that <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/whatsapp/'><img alt='Small WhatsApp Messenger icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/whatsapp_58669.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />WhatsApp Messenger</a> (also owned and operated by <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/facebook/'><img alt='Small Facebook icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/facebook_75888.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Facebook</a>) had when that service implemented support for removing messages back in October of 2017. <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/3/whatsapp-extends-message-deletion-timeframe-to-over-an-hour" rel="nofollow">That limit was raised to over an hour five months later</a>.</p>
<p>Messenger's message deletion feature doesn't have a specific window for when it will be rolled out, though considering that it's showing up in patch notes like this, it must be in the very near future.</p>
