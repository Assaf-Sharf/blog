## More progress in the game page of the Cyworld Project

Today, I made one of the games in the game page work using JavaScript.
The rule of the game is that if the first letter of an answer that I enter matches the last word of the given word, the attempt is legal.
If they do not match, the attempt is illegal.

### My code for today
From the HTML file, I added this line to connect the file with JavaScript file:
```html
<script src="./game.js"></script>
```

And then, I used this code to make the game work in JavaScript:
```javascript
function startWord() {
    let myword = document.getElementById("myword").value
    let word = document.getElementById("word").innerText
    let lastword = word[word.length - 1]
    let firstword = myword[0]
    if (lastword === firstword) {
        document.getElementById("result").innerText = "정답입니다!"
        document.getElementById("word").innerText = myword
        document.getElementById("myword").value = ""
    } else {
        document.getElementById("result").innerText = "땡!"
        document.getElementById("myword").value = ""
    }
}
```
Having the basic understanding of how the game goes, it was fairly easy to make the game using JavaScript, but as always, more practice, the better I get.
