<p><p>Built-in protection against spam is arriving in the stock Android messaging app gradually as of today.</p>
<p>This change is seemingly server-side, as the feature is only available on select devices all running the latest version of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a> according to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/28/spam-protection-is-going-live-in-messages-for-some/" rel="nofollow">testing by Android Police</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/9053541" rel="nofollow">Google's official support page for the feature</a>, if a user reports a message as spam, &quot;Spam reports include a copy of the spammer's messages (up to 10) and go to Google so Messages can better detect future spam for you.&quot; This feature is opt-out by default, and can be accessed by going to the Advanced section of the <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/messenger/'><img alt='Small Android Messages icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/messenger_101243.webp?format=png&width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android Messages</a> settings menu.</p>
<p>Google did not provide any concrete plans for the rollout of this integrated spam protection, but did state that the feature is only currently being gradually rolled out in select countries, with a wider release planned &quot;in the coming months.&quot;</p>
