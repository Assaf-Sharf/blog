<p><p>When you or other participants in a conversation elect to delete a message, you might think that means that the message is gone completely. In Twitter's case at least, this isn't so.</p>
<p>Users can confirm that <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/twitter/'><img alt='Small Twitter icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/twitter_80009.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Twitter</a> has retained these messages by simply <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data" rel="nofollow">downloading the archived data from their account settings page</a>.</p>
<p>Security researcher Karan Saini <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/15/twitter-direct-messages/" rel="nofollow">confirmed with TechCrunch</a> that direct messages sent and received to or from accounts that have been deactivated or suspended are not only still accessible, but can also <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-law-enforcement-support" rel="nofollow">be used by Twitter in cooperation with law enforcement</a>.</p>
<p>In that same TechCrunch report, a Twitter spokesperson commented that the social network is &quot;looking into this further to ensure we have considered the entire scope of the issue.‚Äù This is a far cry from any sort of commitment to changing this practice, and does not ensure that anything will change in practice.</p>
<p>Alternatives to Twitter with similar functionality include <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/mastodon/'><img alt='Small Mastodon icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/mastodon_113561.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Mastodon</a> and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/gnusocial/'><img alt='Small GNU social icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/gnusocial_76245.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />GNU social</a>.</p>
