# <span style ="color: red">What and why people use Tensorflow for?</span>



Let's think of a project to analyze its structure.

How can we make a protein structure into a deep learning structure?

The deep learning model is synonymous with the deep learning structure

How do you create a deep learning model? Tensorflow helps with this







## What is Tensorflow?



It can be said to be a machine learning platform from end to end.

You can quickly create learning codes with Python or JavaScript,

and then these codes are executed  via GPU and TPU.

Various deep learning models are available using TensorFlow hubs.

And the learned model can be added into the app through data preprocessing (numerical encoding) and data structuring.

For example, in a security recognition system, a computer vision model is in a security camera.

We can use Google's system, the largest company in the world, for free to create these models.



## Why TensorFlow?



- Easy to model

In addition, you can use models easily  in various fields,

- Powerful in research.

It's easy and flexible, low cost and good performance.

TensorFlow allows you to do what you should have done for three months with $20,000 hardware and a best engineering team in 2014, for free.



## What are GPU, TPU?



GPU is very fast at numerical computation.

And TPU is a TensorFlow machine learning specialized integrated circuit developed by Google that is faster than GPU. The best part is that you can use it for free.



## What is a Tensor?



Tensor is a numerical representation of something in the world.

Numerically encoded numbers of data, and the representation values before being labeled. This is the tensor.

Tensorflow is litteraly the flow of Tensors. and the process of encoding data and labeling a tensor is itself a Tensor Flow.



## What should you learn?

Fundamentals of tensorflow, data processing (tensoring)

Creating and using a pre-learning deep learning model.

Optimizing the model for the data.

Predicting and evaluating the model with the patterns used by deep learning.

Thinking about how to further develop through evaluation of model prediction.

Adjusting the model repeatedly.

To use a learned model to predict custom data.

The practical importance of ML/DL is in predicting data that has not yet occurred.

We should continue to experiment to find deviations from the standard.



## Workflow of TensorFlow

![img1.daumcdn](/images/2023-04-11-what-is-tensorflow/img1.daumcdn.png)

Numeral Encoding -

Choosing or building a pre-trained models for the problem -

Optimizing and predicting models for your data (getting examples of models little by little to predict results) -

Model Assessment -

Continuing to evolve models through experiments -

Save and update your learned model



## How to learn?



- Write code and make mistakes over and over again.

In the process, if you don't understand well and doubt it, you should try to execute the code often.

- Continue to experiment.

If the experiment fails, you can see what doesn't work. Knowing what doesn't work is often more important than knowing what does work. It is almost impossible to get a goal at once in deep learning.

- Visuallize

If you can't understand the code you're writing, you should try visualizing it,  reconstructing it in an understandable way.

- Always practice.

Try your best on your own before you look up the solutions.

- Share what you've learned

You may have heard a lot about how teaching others is the most effective way to learn.

 The process of the deep learning model is the same. 

It is the process of translating tensors into representation values and then creating understandable results for humans.
