# <span style ="color: red">What and why people use Tensorflow for?</span>



Let's think of a project to analyze its structure.

How can we make a protein structure into a deep learning structure?

The deep learning model is a synonym with the deep learning structure

How do you create a deep learning model? Tensorflow helps with this







## What is Tensorflow?

It can be said to be a machine learning platform from end to end.

You can quickly create learning codes with Python or JavaScript,

These codes are executed again  via GPU and TPU.

Various deep learning models are available using TensorFlow hubs.

And the learned model can be inserted into the app through data preprocessing (numerical encoding) and data structuring.

For example, in a security recognition system, a computer vision model is in a security camera.

We can use Google's system, the largest company in the world, for free.
