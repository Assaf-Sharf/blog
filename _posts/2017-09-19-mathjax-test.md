Will MathJax render some math?

$$ \phi = \frac{G M}{r} $$

We can find the gravitational field from the gradient of the potential $\vec{g} = -\vec{\nabla}\phi$.

$$ \vec{g} = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \, \hat{r} $$

The force experienced by a gravitational charge $m$ in a field $\vec{g}$ is simply

$$ \vec{F} = m\, \vec{g} $$
