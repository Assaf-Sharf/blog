<p>Photo sharing and instant messaging app Snapchat hasn't had the best of luck as of late. Between reporting a loss of 3 million users following the launch of its redesign, as well as a source code breach after releasing the latest version of its app for iOS, today's events are not helping.</p><p>Snapchat revealed in its [second quarter earnings report](https://investor.snap.com/~/media/Files/S/Snap-IR/press-release/q2-18-earnings-release.pdf) that its userbase has decreased from 191 million to 188 million total users. According to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661878/snapchat-earnings-q2-2018-results-redesign), Snap CEO Evan Spiegel stated that the company feels as if it has “...now addressed the biggest frustrations we’ve heard and are eager to make more progress on the tremendous opportunity we now have to show more of the right content to the right people.” This is the first quarter that Snap has reported a loss in user count.</p><p>In addition to this, source code from the iOS version of the Snapchat app was accidentally exposed back in early May, with a (now delisted) [GitHub page for the code](https://github.com/i5xx/Source-SnapChat). A representative from Snap [released a statement to Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywkqew/snapchat-code-leaked-online-github-removed): <br/>“An iOS update in May exposed a small amount of our source code and we were able to identify the mistake and rectify it immediately,” a Snap spokesperson told Motherboard in an email. “We discovered that some of this code had been posted online and it has been subsequently removed. This did not compromise our application and had no impact on our community.”</p><p>In the same article, Motherboard also reports about users trading this code privately following the successful DMCA request to delist the code from GitHub.</p><p>For more coverage of these financial results and code leaks, see the following articles<br/>[The Verge's coverage](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661878/snapchat-earnings-q2-2018-results-redesign)<br/>[TechCrunch's coverage](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/snapchat-earnings-q2-2018/)<br/>[Motherboard's coverage](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywkqew/snapchat-code-leaked-online-github-removed)<br/>[Engadget's coverage](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/07/snapchat-update-revealed-app-source-code/)<br/>[The Next Web's coverage](https://thenextweb.com/security/2018/08/07/hacker-swipes-snapchats-source-code-publishes-it-on-github/)</p>
