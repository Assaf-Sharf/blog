Signing up for Convictional is quite straight forward. There are three fields:

* Email, use your business email.
* Password, use whatever you like, the longer the better.
* Shop, your Shopify shop name

To find your shop name, go to your Shopify admin and look in your URL:

![shop-name](https://github.com/rogerkirkness/convictional-help/blob/master/assets/images/shop.png?raw=true)

Copy/paste the part before .myshopify.com (ie. "convictional-wholesale" in the above example)

Click or tap sign up and you will have a new account.

Go to Settings to configure settings how you need them.
