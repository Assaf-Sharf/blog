<p><p>Facebook is adding the ability for users of its Android app to control whether or not it can access their location in the background even when the app is closed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/02/location-settings-android/" rel="nofollow">a post on the Facebook Newsroom</a> by the social network's Location Infrastructure Engineering Director Paul McDonald, this move is in order to &quot;give people more choice over how we collect location information and how [Facebook stores] it.&quot; This step marks a win for privacy-conscious Android users that still have Facebook on their devices.</p>
<p>McDonald described how this setting will initially be toggled for <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a> users based on their prior settings:<br />
&quot;For people who previously chose to turn their Location History setting 'on,' the new background location setting is 'on.' For people who had turned Location History 'off' – or never turned it on in the first place – the new background location setting is 'off.'&quot;</p>
<p>This feature was already available on devices running on <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_138506.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a> as a feature built into the settings of the Apple operating system, but that sort of granularity wasn't available on the Android <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/facebook/" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> app until now.</p>
