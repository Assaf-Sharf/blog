üìã This is my note-taking from what I learned in the class "Software Engineering Fundamentals - COMP 120-002"

## Traits of Successful Software Engineers

- Sense of individual responsibility.
- Acutely aware of the needs of team members and stakeholders.
- Brutally honest about design flaws and offers constructive criticism.
- Resilient under pressure.
- Heightened sense of fairness.
- Attention to detail.
- Pragmatic adapting software engineering practices based on the circumstances at hand.

<br>

## Behavioral Model for Software Engineering

![Behavioral Model1](../../../assets/images/behaviour%20model.png)
![Behavioral Model2](../../../assets/images/behaviour%20model%202.png)

<br>

## Boundary Spanning Team Roles

1. Ambassador: Represents team to outside constituencies
2. Scout: Crosses team boundaries to collect information
3. Guard: Protects access to team work products
4. Sentry: Controls information sent by stakeholders
5. Coordinator: Communicates across the team and organization

<br>

## Effective Software Team Attributes

- Sense of purpose.
- Sense of involvement.
- Sense of trust.
- Sense of improvement.
- Diversity of team member skill sets.

<br>

## Avoid Team "Toxicity"

- A frenzied work atmosphere in which team members waste energy and lose focus on the objectives of the work to be performed.
- High frustration caused by personal, business, or technological factors that cause friction among team members.
- Fragmented or poorly coordinated procedures or a poorly defined or improperly chosen process model that becomes a roadblock to accomplishment.
- Unclear definition of team roles resulting in a lack of accountability and resultant finger-pointing.
- Continuous and repeated exposure to failure that leads to a loss of confidence and a lowering of morale(poor morale).

<br>

## Project Factors Affecting Team Structure

The following factors must be considered when selecting a software project team structure:

- The <u>difficulty of the problem</u> to be solved.
- The <u>size of the resultant program(s)</u> in lines of code or function points.
- The <u>time that the team will stay together</u> (team lifetime).
- The <u>degree to which the problem can be modularized</u>.
- The <u>required quality and reliability</u> of the system to be built.
- The <u>rigidity of the delivery date</u>.
- The <u>degree of sociability</u> (communication) required for the project.

<br>

## Organizational Paradigms

### 1. Closed Paradigm

Structures a team along a traditional hierarchy of authority.

### 2. Random Paradigm

Structures a team loosely and depends on individual initiative of the team members.

### 3. Open Paradigm

Attempts to structure a team in a manner that achieves some of the controls associated with the closed paradigm but also much of the innovation that occurs when using the random paradigm.

### 4. Synchronous Paradigm

Relies on the natural compartmentalization of a problem and organizes team members to work on pieces of the problem with little active communication among themselves.

<br>

## Generic Agile Teams

Stress individual competency coupled with group collaboration as critical success factors.

People trump process and politics can trump people.

Agile teams as self-organizing and have many structures.

- An adaptive team structure
- Uses elements of Constantine‚Äôs random, open, and synchronous structures
- Significant autonomy

Communication among developers and stakeholders is important (consider adding customer rep to team).

Planning is kept to a minimum and constrained only by business requirements and organizational standards.

<br>

## XP Team Values

- Communication &rarr; close informal verbal communication among team members and stakeholders and establishing meaning for metaphors as part of continuous feedback

- Simplicity &rarr; design for immediate needs nor future needs

- Feedback &rarr; derives from the implemented software, the customer, and other team members

- Courage &rarr; the discipline to resist pressure to design for unspecified future requirements

- Respect &rarr; among team members and stakeholders

<br>

## Impact of Social Media

- Social processes around software development are highly depend on engineers‚Äô abilities to connect with individuals who share similar goals and complementary skills.
- Value of social networking tools grows as team size increases or when a team is geographically dispersed.
- Privacy and security issues should not be overlooked when using social media for software engineering work.
- Benefits of social media must be weighed against the threat of uncontrolled disclosure of proprietary information.

### <u>Examples of Social Media</u>

- Blogs &rarr; can be used share information with team members and customers
- Microblogs (e.g. Twitter) &rarr; allow posting of real-time messages to individuals following the poster
- Targeted on-line forums &rarr; allow participants to post questions or opinions and collect answers
- Social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) &rarr; allows connections among software developers for the purpose of sharing information
- Social book marking (e.g. Delicious, Stumble, CiteULike) &rarr; allow developers to keep track of and share web-based resources

<br>

## Team Decision Making Complications

- Problem complexity.
- Uncertainty and risk associated with the decision.
- Work associated with decision has unintended effect on another project object (law of unintended consequences).
- Different views of the problem lead to different conclusions about the way forward.
- Global software teams face additional challenges associated with collaboration, coordination, and communication difficulties.

<br>

## Software Engineering using the Cloud

### <u>Benefits</u>

- Provides access to all software engineering work products
- Removes device dependencies and available every where
- Provides avenues for distributing and testing software
- Allows software engineering information developed by one member to be available to all team members

### <u>Concerns</u>

- Dispersing cloud services outside the control of the software team may present reliability and security risks
- Potential for interoperability problems becomes high with large number of services distributed on the cloud
- Cloud services stress usability and performance which often conflicts with security, privacy, and reliability

<br>

## Collaboration Tools

Namespace that allows secure, private storage or work products

Calendar for coordinating project events

Templates that allow team members to create artifacts that have common look and feel

Metrics support to allow quantitative assessment of each team member‚Äôs contributions

Communication analysis to track messages and isolates patterns that may imply issues to resolve

Artifact clustering showing work product dependencies
