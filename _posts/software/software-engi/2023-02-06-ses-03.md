## What is Agility?

- Effective (rapid and adaptive) response to change.
- Effective communication among all stakeholders.
- Drawing the customer onto the team.
- Organizing a team so that it is in control of the work performed.
- Rapid, incremental delivery of software.

## Agility and Cost of Change

<br>

## What is an Agile Process?

- Driven by customer descriptions of what is required (scenarios).
- Customer feedback is frequent and acted on.
- Recognizes that plans are short-lived.
- Develops software iteratively with a heavy emphasis on construction activities.
- Delivers multiple ‚Äòsoftware increments‚Äô as executable prototypes.
- Adapts as project or technical changes occur.

<br>

## Agility Principles

- Customer satisfaction is achieved by providing value through software that is delivered to the customer as rapidly as possible.
- Develop recognize that requirements will change and welcome changes.
- Deliver software increments frequently (weeks not months) to stakeholders to ensure feedback on their deliveries is meaningful.
- Agile team populated by motivated individuals using face-to- face communication to convey information.
- Team process encourages technical excellence, good design, simplicity, and avoids unnecessary work.
- Working software that meets customer needs is the primary goal.
- Pace and direction of the team‚Äôs work must be ‚Äúsustainable,‚Äù enabling them to work effectively for long periods of time.
- An agile team is a ‚Äúself-organizing team‚Äù‚Äîone that can be trusted develop well-structured architectures that lead to solid designs and customer satisfaction.
- Part of the team culture is to consider its work introspectively with the intent of improving how to become more effective its primary goal (customer satisfaction).

## Scrum Framework

![Scrum Framework](../../../assets/images/Scrum%20Framework.png)

### <u>Scrum Details</u>

- Backlog Refinement Meeting Developers work with stakeholders to create product backlog.
- Sprint Planning Meeting Backlog partitioned into ‚Äúsprints‚Äù derived from backlog and next sprint defined.
- Daily Scrum Meeting Team members synchronize their activities and plan work day (15 minutes max).
- Sprint Review Prototype ‚Äúdemos‚Äù are delivered to the stakeholders for approval or rejection.
- Sprint Retrospective After sprint is complete, team considers what went well and what needs improvement.

<u>Pros</u>

- Product owner sets priorities.
- Team owns decision making.
- Documentation is lightweight.
- Supports frequent updating.

<u>Cons</u>

- Difficult to control the cost of changes.
- May not be suitable for large teams.
- Requires expert team members.

## Extreme Programming (XP) Framework

![Extreme Programming (XP) Framework](<../../../assets/images/Extreme%20Programming%20(XP)%20Framework.png>)

### <u>XP Details</u>

- XP Planning ‚Äì Begins with user stories, team estimates cost, stories grouped into increments, commitment made on delivery date, computer project velocity.
- XP Design ‚Äì Follows KIS principle, encourages use of CRC cards, design prototypes, and refactoring.
- XP Coding ‚Äì construct unit tests before coding, uses pair.
- XP Testing ‚Äì unit tests executed daily, acceptance tests define by customer.

<u>Pros</u>

- Emphasizes customer involvement.
- Establishes rational plans and schedules.
- High developer commitment to the project.
- Reduced likelihood of product rejection.

<u>Cons</u>

- Temptation to ‚Äúship‚Äù a prototype.
- Requires frequent meetings about increasing costs.
- Allows for excessive changes.
- Depends on highly skilled team members.

### <u>Kanban Details</u>

- Visualizing workflow using a Kanban board.
- Limiting the amount of work in progress at any given time.
- Managing workflow to reduce waste by understanding the current value flow.
- Making process policies explicit and the criteria used to define ‚Äúdone‚Äù.
- Focusing on continuous improvement by creating feedback loops where changes are introduced.
- Make process changes collaboratively and involve all stakeholders as needed.

<u>Pros</u>

- Lower budget and time requirements.
- Allows early product delivery.
- Process policies written down.

- Flexibility can cause developers to lose focus.
- Developer reluctance to use measurement.

<br>

## DevOps

![DevOps](../../../assets/images/DevOps.png)

### <u>DevOps Details</u>

- Continuous development. Software delivered in multiple sprints.
- Continuous testing. Automated testing tools used prior to integration.
- Continuous integration. Code pieces with new functionality added to existing code running code.
- Continuous deployment. Integrated code is deployed to the production environment.
- Continuous monitoring. Team operations staff members proactively monitor software performance in the production environment.

<u>Pros</u>

- Reduced time to code deployment.
- Team has developers and operations staff.
- Team has end-to-end project ownership.
- Proactive monitoring of deployed product.

<u>Cons</u>

- Pressure to work on both old and new code.
