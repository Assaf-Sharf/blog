## Software Process Models

![Software Process Models](../../../assets/images/traditional_agile.png)

<br>

## A Generic Process Model

A process is defined as a collection of work activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when some work product is to be created. Each of these activities, actions, and tasks reside within a framework or model that defines their relationship with the process and with one another.

![A Generic Process Model](../../../assets/images/A%20Generic%20Process%20Model.png)

Each framework activity is populated by a set of software engineering actions. Each software engineering action is defined by a task set that identifies the work tasks that are to be completed, the work products that will be produced, the quality assurance points that will be required, and the milestones that will be used to indicate progress.

A generic process framework for software engineering defines five framework activities:

1. Communication
2. Planning
3. Modeling
4. Construction
5. Deployment

In addition, a set of umbrella activities ‚Äî project tracking and control, risk management, quality assurance, configuration management, technical reviews, and others ‚Äî are applied throughout the process.

You should note that one important aspect of the software process has not yet been discussed. This aspect ‚Äî called process flow ‚Äî describes how the framework activities and the actions and tasks that occur within each framework activity are organized with respect to sequence and time.

<br>

## Process Flows

### <u>Linear Process Flow</u>

![Linear](../../../assets/images/Linear.png)

A linear process flow executes each of the five framework activities in sequence, beginning with communication and culminating with deployment.

### <u>Iterative Process Flow</u>

![Iterative](../../../assets/images/Iterative.png)

An iterative process flow repeats one or more of the activities before proceeding to the next.

### <u>Evolutionary Process Flow</u>

![Evolutionary](../../../assets/images/Evolutionary.png)

An evolutionary process flow executes the activities in a ‚Äúcircular‚Äù manner.

Each circuit through the five activities leads to a more complete version of the software.

### <u>Parallel Process Flow</u>

![Parallel](../../../assets/images/Parallel.png)

A parallel process flow executes one or more activities in parallel with other activities (e.g., modeling for one aspect of the software might be executed in parallel with construction of another aspect of the software).

<br>

## Identifying a Task Set

A task set defines the actual work to be done to accomplish the objectives of a software engineering action.

A task set is defined by creating several lists:

- A list of the tasks to be accomplished.
- A list of the work products to be produced.
- A list of the quality assurance filters to be applied.

### <u>List of Tasks - After SCRUM meeting</u>

[SCRUM meeting](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/scrum-meeting/)

Discussions with:

- Domain Expert
- Other developers in the team
- Business Analyst
- Professional Services
- Customer Services
- Clients
- Other stakeholders

Write a Requirement Analysis Document

<br>

## 5 Questions Designers Should Ask

1. Is the product satisfactory, or does it require redesign or rework?
2. Was user input solicited, to avoid the product being unsatisfactory and requiring rework?
3. Is there a need for new requirements?
4. Is the product larger than estimated?
5. Did the modules require more testing, design and implementation work to correct than expected?

<br>

## Process Patterns

Every software team encounters problems as it moves through the software process. It would be useful if proven solutions to these problems were readily available to the team so that the problems could be addressed and resolved quickly.

A process pattern:

1. Describes a process-related problem that is encountered during software engineering work.
2. Identifies the environment in which the problem has been encountered.
3. Suggests one or more proven solutions to the problem.

Stated in more general terms, a process pattern provides you with a template [Amb98] ‚Äî a consistent method for describing problem solutions within the context of the software process.

### <u>Process Pattern Types</u>

- Stage patterns: Defines a problem associated with a framework activity for the process.
- Task patterns: Defines a problem associated with a software engineering action or work task and relevant to successful software engineering practice.
- Phase patterns: Define the sequence of framework activities that occur with the process, even when the overall flow of activities is iterative in nature.

## Process Assessment and Improvement

- The existence of a software process is no guarantee that software will be delivered on time, or meet the customer‚Äôs needs, or that it will exhibit long-term quality characteristics.
- Any software process can be assessed to ensure that it meets a set of basic process criteria that have been shown to be essential for successful software engineering.
- Software processes and activities should be assessed using numeric measures or software analytics (metrics).

### <u>Lists of Process Assessment and Improvement Standards</u>

- Standard CMMI Assessment Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI)

  : Provides a five step process assessment model that incorporates five phases: initiating, diagnosing, establishing, acting and learning.

- CMM-Based Appraisal for Internal Process Improvement (CBA IPI)

  : Provides a diagnostic technique for assessing the relative maturity of a software organization; uses the SEI CMM as the basis for the assessment [Dun01]

- The SPICE (ISO/IEC15504) standard

  : The SPICE (ISO/IEC15504) standard defines a set of requirements for software process assessment. The intent of the standard is to assist organizations in developing an objective evaluation of the efficacy of any defined software process. [ISO08]

- ISO 9001:2000 for Software

  : A generic standard that applies to any organization that wants to improve the overall quality of the products, systems, or services that it provides. Therefore, the standard is directly applicable to software organizations and companies. [Ant06]

<br>

## Prescriptive Process Models

Prescriptive process models advocate an orderly approach to
software engineering.

That leads to a two questions:

- If prescriptive process models strive for structure and order, are they appropriate for a software world that thrives on change?
- If we reject traditional process models and replace them with something less structured, do we make it impossible to achieve coordination and coherence in software work?

### <u>Waterfall Process Model</u>

![waterfall](../../../assets/images/Waterfall%20.png)

Pros

- It is easy to understand and plan.
- It works for well-understood small projects.
- Analysis and testing are straightforward.

Cons

- It does not accommodate change well.
- Testing occurs late in the process.
- Customer approval is at the end.

### <u>Prototyping Process Model</u>

![prototyping](../../../assets/images/Prototyping%20.png)

Pros

- Reduced impact of requirement changes.
- Customer is involved early and often.
- Works well for small projects.
- Reduced likelihood of product rejection.

Cons

- Customer involvement may cause delays.
- Temptation to ‚Äúship‚Äù a prototype.
- Work lost in a throwaway prototype.
- Hard to plan and manage.

### <u>Spiral Process Model</u>

![spiral](../../../assets/images/Spiral%20.png)

Pros

- Continuous customer involvement.
- Development risks are managed.
- Suitable for large, complex projects.
- It works well for extensible products.

Cons

- Risk analysis failures can doom the project.

## Networking and its types (LAN, WAN, WLAN, MAN, SAN, PAN, EPN & VPN)

### <u>Networking</u>

: A Computer Networking is a system in which multiple computers are connected to each other to share information and resources. A computer network is a collection of interconnected computers that share information. The term "network" can refer to either computer physical connections or conceptual interconnections between system components.
![Networking](../../../assets/images/networking.png)

### <u>Types of Networking</u>

1. [LAN](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/local-area-network)
   : A LAN is a computer network consisting of switches that allow access points, cables, routers, and devices to connect to web servers and internal servers within a single building, campus, or home network. Devices on a LAN (typically personal computers and workstations) can share and access files with each other over a single Internet connection.
   ![lan](../../../assets/images/lan.jpeg)

2. [WAN](https://www.edrawsoft.com/wan-diagrams.html)
   : Wide-area networks (also known as WANs) are large computer networks that are not connected in one place. WAN providers allow WANs to communicate, share information, and more among devices worldwide. Because the Internet is the world's largest WAN, it is critical for multinational corporations and necessary for everyday use.
   ![wan](../../../assets/images/wan.png)

3. [WLAN](https://www.conceptdraw.com/examples/wireless-wlan)
   : Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is a wireless deployment method for two or more devices. WLANs use high-frequency radio waves and often include access points to the Internet. WLANs allow users to move through coverage areas (typically homes or small offices) while maintaining network connectivity.
   ![wlan](../../../assets/images/wlan.png)

4. [MAN](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/metropolitan-area-network-MAN)
   : A metropolitan area network traditionally refers to a network of personal data used by a single organization of several buildings or by multiple interconnected organizations in the same geographical neighborhood. It is larger than a single building's LAN, but not large enough to be considered a WAN. The size is usually between 5 and 50 kilometers. If all buildings are in a single adjacent building, they can also be considered campus networks.
   ![man](../../../assets/images/man.png)

5. [SAN](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/storage-area-network-SAN)
   : A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network or subnetwork that interconnects and provides shared pools of storage devices to multiple servers. SAN technology addresses advanced enterprise storage needs by providing a separate, highly scalable, dedicated, high-performance network designed to interconnect multiple servers to a variety of storage devices.
   ![san](../../../assets/images/san.jpeg)

6. [PAN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-personal-area-network/)
   : A private area network (PAN) connects electronic devices in the area directly next to the user. PANs vary in size from a few centimeters to a few meters. One of the most common real-world examples of PAN is the connection between Bluetooth earphones and smartphones. PAN can also connect laptops, tablets, printers, keyboards, and other computerized devices.
   ![pan](../../../assets/images/pan.jpeg)

7. [EPN](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/epn.asp)
   : An enterprise private network is a computer network that enables companies with many different offices to securely connect these offices to each office over the network. Enterprise-only networks are primarily set up to share computer resources.
   ![epn](../../../assets/images/epn.jpeg)

8. [VPN](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-vpn)
   : VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network," which describes the opportunity to establish a protected network connection when using a public network. VPNs encrypt Internet traffic and disguise online IDs. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal your data. Encryption occurs in real time.
   ![vpn](../../../assets/images/vpn.jpeg)
