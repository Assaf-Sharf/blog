## Software Process Models

<br>

## A Generic Process Model

A process is defined as a collection of work activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when some work product is to be created. Each of these activities, actions, and tasks reside within a framework or model that defines their relationship with the process and with one another.

![A Generic Process Model](../../../assets/images/A%20Generic%20Process%20Model.png)

Each framework activity is populated by a set of software engineering actions. Each software engineering action is defined by a task set that identifies the work tasks that are to be completed, the work products that will be produced, the quality assurance points that will be required, and the milestones that will be used to indicate progress.

A generic process framework for software engineering defines five framework activities:

1. Communication
2. Planning
3. Modeling
4. Construction
5. Deployment

In addition, a set of umbrella activities ‚Äî project tracking and control, risk management, quality assurance, configuration management, technical reviews, and others ‚Äî are applied throughout the process.

You should note that one important aspect of the software process has not yet been discussed. This aspect ‚Äî called process flow ‚Äî describes how the framework activities and the actions and tasks that occur within each framework activity are organized with respect to sequence and time.

<br>

## Process Flows

### <u>Linear Process Flow</u>

![Linear](../../../assets/images/Linear.png)

A linear process flow executes each of the five framework activities in sequence, beginning with communication and culminating with deployment.

### <u>Iterative Process Flow</u>

![Iterative](../../../assets/images/Iterative.png)

An iterative process flow repeats one or more of the activities before proceeding to the next.

### <u>Evolutionary Process Flow</u>

![Evolutionary](../../../assets/images/Evolutionary.png)

An evolutionary process flow executes the activities in a ‚Äúcircular‚Äù manner.

Each circuit through the five activities leads to a more complete version of the software.

### <u>Parallel Process Flow</u>

![Parallel](../../../assets/images/Parallel.png)

A parallel process flow executes one or more activities in parallel with other activities (e.g., modeling for one aspect of the software might be executed in parallel with construction of another aspect of the software).

<br>

## Identifying a Task Set

A task set defines the actual work to be done to accomplish the objectives of a software engineering action.

- A list of the tasks to be accomplished
- A list of the work products to be produced
- A list of the quality assurance filters to be applied

### <u>List of Tasks - After [SCRUM meeting](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/scrum-meeting/)</u>

Discussions with:

- Domain Expert
- Other developers in the team
- Business Analyst
- Professional Services
- Customer Services
- Clients
- Other stakeholders

Write a Requirement Analysis Document

<br>

## 5 Questions Designers Should Ask

1. Is the product satisfactory, or does it require redesign or rework?
2. Was user input solicited, to avoid the product being unsatisfactory and requiring rework?
3. Is there a need for new requirements?
4. Is the product larger than estimated?
5. Did the modules require more testing, design and implementation work to correct than expected?
