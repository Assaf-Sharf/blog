## 1. Scrum

A very popular agile software development method, originally proposed by Sutherland, and further developed by Schwaber and Beedle.

Scrum incorporates the following framework activities: "requirements", "analysis", "design", "evolution", and "delivery".

The scrum process involves:

- Sprint Planning Meetings
- Daily Scrum Meetings
- Sprint Review Meetings
- Sprint Retrospective

![Scrum](../../../assets/images/Scrum.png)
![Scrum Framework](../../../assets/images/Scrum%20Framework.png)

Some of the distinguishing features if the Scrum process includes:

- Development work is partitioned into "packets".
- "Testing and documentation are on-going" as the product is constructed.
- Work occurs in "sprints" and is derived from a "backlog" of existing requirements.
- "Meetings are very short" and sometimes conducted without chairs.
- "Demos" are delivered to the customer with the time-box allocated.

[What is Scrum?](https://youtu.be/TRcReyRYIMg)

### <u>Scrum Details</u>

- Backlog Refinement Meeting Developers work with stakeholders to create product backlog.
- Sprint Planning Meeting Backlog partitioned into ‚Äúsprints‚Äù derived from backlog and next sprint defined.
- Daily Scrum Meeting Team members synchronize their activities and plan work day (15 minutes max).
- Sprint Review Prototype ‚Äúdemos‚Äù are delivered to the stakeholders for approval or rejection.
- Sprint Retrospective After sprint is complete, team considers what went well and what needs improvement.

<u>Pros</u>

- Product owner sets priorities.
- Team owns decision making.
- Documentation is lightweight.
- Supports frequent updating.

<u>Cons</u>

- Difficult to control the cost of changes.
- May not be suitable for large teams.
- Requires expert team members.

## 2. Extreme Programming (XP)

The one of the most widely used agile approaches to agile software development, originally proposed by Kent Beck.

Extreme Programming encompasses a set of rules and practices that occur within the context of four framework activities: planning, design, coding, and testing.

![XP](../../../assets/images/XP.png)
![Extreme Programming (XP) Framework](<../../../assets/images/Extreme%20Programming%20(XP)%20Framework.png>)

1. Planning
   : - Begins with the creation of <u>‚Äúuser stories‚Äù</u>
   : - Agile team assesses each story and assigns a <u>cost</u>
   : - Stories are grouped to for a <u>deliverable increment</u>
   : - A <u>commitment</u> is made on delivery date
   : - After the first increment <u>‚Äúproject velocity‚Äù</u> is used to help define subsequent delivery dates for other increments
2. Design
   : - Follows the <u>KISS principle</u>
   : - Encourage the use of <u>CRC cards</u> (see Chapter 8)
   : - For difficult design problems, suggests the creation of <u>‚Äúspike solutions‚Äù</u> ‚Äî a design prototype
   : - Encourages <u>‚Äúrefactoring‚Äù</u> ‚Äî an iterative refinement of the internal program design
3. Coding
   : - Recommends the <u>construction of a unit test</u> for a store before coding commences
   : - Encourages <u>‚Äúpair programming‚Äù</u>
4. Testing
   : - All <u>unit tests are executed daily</u>
   : - <u>‚ÄúAcceptance tests‚Äù</u> are defined by the customer and excuted to assess customer visible functionality

### <u>XP Details</u>

- XP Planning ‚Äì Begins with user stories, team estimates cost, stories grouped into increments, commitment made on delivery date, computer project velocity.
- XP Design ‚Äì Follows KIS principle, encourages use of CRC cards, design prototypes, and refactoring.
- XP Coding ‚Äì construct unit tests before coding, uses pair.
- XP Testing ‚Äì unit tests executed daily, acceptance tests define by customer.

<u>Pros</u>

- Emphasizes customer involvement.
- Establishes rational plans and schedules.
- High developer commitment to the project.
- Reduced likelihood of product rejection.

<u>Cons</u>

- Temptation to ‚Äúship‚Äù a prototype.
- Requires frequent meetings about increasing costs.
- Allows for excessive changes.
- Depends on highly skilled team members.

## 3. Kanban

![Kanban Framework](../../../assets/images/Kanban%20Framework.png)

Kanban describes methods for improving any process or workflow. Kanban is focused on change management and service delivery. It originated at Toyota and is comprised of six core practices:

1. Visualizing with a Kanban board
   : - The Kanban board is organized into columns representing the development stage for each element of software functionality. The cards on the board might contain single user stories or recently discovered defects, and the team would advance them from "To do, "Doing", and "Done" as the project progresses.
   : - Examples of software that supports kanban development projects include GitHub, Jira, and Trello.
2. Limiting WIP
   : - Developers are encouraged to complete their current task before starting another, to limit the amount of work in progress (WIP) at any given time.
   : - This reduces lead time, improves work quality, and increases the team's ability to deliver software functionality frequently to their stakeholders.
3. Managing workflow
   : - Managing workflow to reduce waste by understanding the current value flow, analyzing places where it is stalled, defining changes, and then implementing the changes.
4. Having defined process policies
   : - Making process policies explicit (e.g. write down your reasons for selecting items to work on and the criteria used to define "Done".)
5. Continuous improvement
   : - Focusing on continuous improvement by creating feedback loops where changes are introduced based on process data and the effects of the change on the process are measured after the changes are made.
6. Collaboration
   : - Make process changes collaboratively and involve all team members and other stakeholders as needed.

### <u>Kanban Details</u>

- Visualizing workflow using a Kanban board.
- Limiting the amount of work in progress at any given time.
- Managing workflow to reduce waste by understanding the current value flow.
- Making process policies explicit and the criteria used to define ‚Äúdone‚Äù.
- Focusing on continuous improvement by creating feedback loops where changes are introduced.
- Make process changes collaboratively and involve all stakeholders as needed.

<u>Pros</u>

- Lower budget and time requirements.
- Allows early product delivery.
- Process policies written down.
- Continuous process improvement.

<u>Cons</u>

- Team collaboration skills determine success.
- Poor business analysis can doom the project.
- Flexibility can cause developers to lose focus.
- Developer reluctance to use measurement.

## 4. DevOps

DevOps was created to combine Development and Operations. It attempts to apply agile development principles across the entire software supply chain.

![DevOps](../../../assets/images/DevOps2.png)
![DevOps](../../../assets/images/DevOps.png)

The DevOps approach involves several stages that loop continuously until the desired product exists:

- <u>Continuous development.</u> Software deliverables are broken down and developed in multiple sprints with the increments delivered to the quality assurance members of the development team for testing.
- <u>Continuous testing.</u> Automated testing tools are used to help team members test multiple code increments at the same time to ensure they are free of defects prior to integration.
- <u>Continuous integration.</u> The code pieces with new functionality are added to the existing code and to the runtime environment and then checked to ensure there are no errors after deployment.
- <u>Continuous deployment.</u> At this stage the integrated code is deployed (installed) to the production environment, which might include multiple sites globally that need to be prepared to receive the new funcitonality.
- <u>Continuous monitoring.</u> Operations staff who are members of the development team to help improve software quality by monitoring its performance in the production environment and proactively looking for possible problems before users find them.

### <u>DevOps Details</u>

- Continuous development. Software delivered in multiple sprints.
- Continuous testing. Automated testing tools used prior to integration.
- Continuous integration. Code pieces with new functionality added to existing code running code.
- Continuous deployment. Integrated code is deployed to the production environment.
- Continuous monitoring. Team operations staff members proactively monitor software performance in the production environment.

<u>Pros</u>

- Reduced time to code deployment.
- Team has developers and operations staff.
- Team has end-to-end project ownership.
- Proactive monitoring of deployed product.

<u>Cons</u>

- Pressure to work on both old and new code.
- Heavy reliance on automated tools to be effective.
- Deployment may affect the production environment.
- Requires an expert development team.
