## Memory

Computer memory = Human brain

- Store data and instructions
- Memory is divided into large number of small parts called "cells"
- Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one
  - Computer has 64k words
  - Memory unit has 64\*1024 = 65536 memory locations
  - The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535

> **Cache Memory:**
>
> - Very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU
> - Act as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory
> - Hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU
> - Transfer the parts of data and programs from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them
>
> **Advantages**
>
> - Cache memory is faster than main memory
> - Consume less access time as compared to main memory
> - Store the program that can be executed within a short period of time
> - Store data for temporary use
>
> **Disadvantages**
>
> - Cache memory has limited capacity
> - Very expensive

> **Primary Memory (Main Memory)**
>
> - Semiconductor memory
> - Usually volatile memory
> - A limited capacity
> - Data is lost when power is switched off
> - Hold only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working
> - Faster than secondary memory
> - Not as fast as registers
> - A computer cannot run without the primary memory
> - Divide into two subcategories **RAM** and **ROM**

> **Secondary Memory**
>
> - Magnetic and optical memory
