## Memory

Computer memory = Human brain

- Store data and instructions
- Memory is divided into large number of small parts called "cells"
- Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one
  - Computer has 64k words
  - Memory unit has 64\*1024 = 65536 memory locations
  - The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535

> **Cache Memory:**
>
> - Very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU(Central Processing Unit)
> - Act as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory
> - Hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU
> - Transfer the parts of data and programs from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them
>
> **Advantages**
>
> - Cache memory is faster than main memory
> - Consume less access time as compared to main memory
> - Store the program that can be executed within a short period of time
> - Store data for temporary use
>
> **Disadvantages**
>
> - Cache memory has limited capacity
> - Very expensive

> **Primary Memory (Main Memory)**
>
> - Semiconductor memory
> - Usually volatile memory
> - A limited capacity
> - Data is lost when power is switched off
> - Hold only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working
> - Faster than secondary memory
> - Not as fast as registers
> - Computer cannot run without the primary memory
> - Divide into two subcategories **RAM** and **ROM**

> **Secondary Memory**
>
> - Magnetic and optical memory
> - Backup memory
> - External and non-volatile memory
> - Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off
> - Used for storage of data in a computer
> - Computer may run without the secondary memory
> - Slower than primary memory
> - CPU directly does not access these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines &rarr; the contents of secondary memories are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it [ex) disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc.]

## Random Access Memory (RAM)

- Internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result
- Read/Write memory which stores data until the machine is working
- As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased
- Access time in RAM is independent of the address = Each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other locations and take the same amount of time
- Data in the RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive
- Volatile = Data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure &rarr; Backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computer
- RAM is small, both in terms of physical size and the amount of data it can hold

> **Static RAM**
>
> - Static = The memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied, but data is lost when the power gets down
> - SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors
> - Long life and Large size
> - No need to refresh = Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage
> - High power consumption
> - Extra space in the matrix &rarr; Use more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space &rarr; Expensive, Faster, and Used as cache memory

> **Dynamic RAM**
>
> - Need to be refreshed continuously to maintain the data = Done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second
> - Slower as compared to SRAM
> - Used as RAM
> - Short data lifetime
> - Less expensive and Small &rarr; Used for most system memory
> - Less power consumption
> - All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor

## Read-Only Memory (ROM)

- Only read but cannot write on it
- Non-volatile
- Store permanently in such memories during manufacture
- Store such instructions that are required to start a computer
- This operation is referred to as bootstrap
- ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave ovens

> MROM (Masked ROM)
>
> - The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions
> - Inexpensive

> PROM

> EPROM

> EEPROM
