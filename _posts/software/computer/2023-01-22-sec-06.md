## Lab 1

### Instructions

- Objective: Learn about computer peripherals and hardware.
- Describe computer components, include pictures
- Include header ‚Äì student name and section, include page number in the footer
- Include cover page and page border
- Include 5 to 10 pages excluding the cover page and references
- Use Times New Romans, single spaced, and 12 size.
- Put the reference at the end of the document.
- Use APA for reference format.

### Question 1:

Describe computer components, include pictures

1. Computer architecture
   : Computer architecture refers to the overall design and organization of a computer system. Functional units of a system such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices, including the way in which these units are connected to each other are all encompassed in it. Key factors such as performance, power consumption, and cost are considered by computer architects when designing a computer system. Some examples for computer architecture include Von Neumann, Harvard, and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architectures.

2. CPU
   : A CPU (Central Processing Unit) AKA the processer is the primary component of a computer. Also referred as the brain of the computer the CPU performs most of the processing. Tasks are done by retrieving important instructions from the memory of the computer and decoding them to execute the given task. The CPU is located on the motherboard and can come in single or multiple cores depending on the amount of performance needed by the user. They are heat-generating components which can produce up to 110¬∞ C. The clock speed of the CPU is calculated in GHz, it determines the number of instructions that can be executed per second. Modern day CPUs also include a cache, a small amount of memory which is fast enough for the CPU to access quickly to speed up processing.

3. IO devices
   : Input/output devices are hardware components that helps a computer to access and communicate with the outer world and the user. They allow data to be transferred from computer to other devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, or storage devices. For example, a keyboard allows users to input texts and commands, a monitor allows users to view the output of the computer. Furthermore, there are storage devices such as hard disks, flash drives, and memory cards that are used for both input and output depending on the operation.

4. Memory
5. Memory units
6. Motherboard ports
7. Other latest devices (3 latest technologies)

### Question 2:

What is the best configuration when purchasing a new computer?
