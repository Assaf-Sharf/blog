### Question 1:

Describe computer components, include pictures

1. Computer architecture
   : Computer architecture refers to the overall design and organization of a computer system. Functional units of a system such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices, including the way in which these units are connected to each other are all encompassed in it. Key factors such as performance, power consumption, and cost are considered by computer architects when designing a computer system. Some examples for computer architecture include Von Neumann, Harvard, and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architectures.

2. CPU
   : A CPU (Central Processing Unit) AKA the processer is the primary component of a computer. Also referred as the brain of the computer the CPU performs most of the processing. Tasks are done by retrieving important instructions from the memory of the computer and decoding them to execute the given task. The CPU is located on the motherboard and can come in single or multiple cores depending on the amount of performance needed by the user. They are heat-generating components which can produce up to 110° C. The clock speed of the CPU is calculated in GHz, it determines the number of instructions that can be executed per second. Modern day CPUs also include a cache, a small amount of memory which is fast enough for the CPU to access quickly to speed up processing.

3. IO devices
   : Input/output devices are hardware components that helps a computer to access and communicate with the outer world and the user. They allow data to be transferred from computer to other devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, or storage devices. For example, a keyboard allows users to input texts and commands, a monitor allows users to view the output of the computer. Furthermore, there are storage devices such as hard disks, flash drives, and memory cards that are used for both input and output depending on the operation.

4. Memory &rarr; There are two types of memories in a computer, RAM’s, and ROM's.
   : - RAM: Random Access Memory, or RAM, is a type of memory used in computers that stores data so that the CPU can access it quickly. It acts as a temporary storage for data and instructions that are currently being processed by the CPU. RAM is temporary, meaning all the files in it are deleted when the computer is powered off. Having more RAM affects the performance of the computer because more RAM can provide more storage for data to be accessed quickly increasing the performance significantly.
   : - ROM: Read only memory or ROM, is used to store data for a longer period. It is not directly accessed by the CPU, but rather is accessed through input/output operations so it is non-volatile. Some examples of ROM are hard disk drives, solid-state drives (SSD), flash drives, and memory cards.

5. Memory units
   : Over the time computers memory has developed and grown more and more, this caused new units of memories to be developed to keep up with the upcoming demand. A memory unit is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage unit. The different memory units defining the memory size is given in the table below.

   | Unit               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Bit (Binary Digit) | A binary digit is logical 0 and 1 representing a passive or an active state of a component in an electric circuit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | Nibble             | A group of 4 bits is called nibble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | Byte               | A group of 8 bits is called byte. A byte is the smallest unit, which can represent a data item or a character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | Word               | A computer word, like a byte, is a group of fixed number of bits processed as a unit, which varies from computer to computer but is fixed for each computer. The length of a computer word is called word-size or word length. It may be as small as 8 bits or may be as long as 96 bits. A computer stores the information in the form of computer words. |

   : - Gaming laptops: These are high-performance laptops specifically designed for gaming, with powerful CPUs, GPUs, and high-refresh-rate displays

### Question 2:

What is the best configuration when purchasing a new computer?

We all have different purpose for buying a computer. Some of us require an extremely high-end device while others might not need so much of high-end features/components but one thing that is common is almost everyone of us has a budget. So, we need to look at some of the very important components of a computer mentioned below and decide as per ones need and budget.

1. Processor
   : The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of a computer. It is the component of a computer that executes the programs. The Processor provides instructions and the power for processing its work. The more updated and advanced is the processor the faster and effectively the computer can perform its task. Hence, it’s important to consider a good processor.

2. Ram
   : Random Access Memory is a short-term memory of a computer where the currently used data are stored. It makes the performance much faster since the computer can access the data from RAM easily than HDD or SDD. Computer performs the task faster and properly if the RAM has more storage.

3. SSD
   : We can find computers that has either SSD (Standard Disk Drive) or HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or both. SSD promotes in speed, less use of power and more battery life. HDD is a disk whereas SSD is like a pen drive which doesn’t produce sound unlike HDD which produce more sound and is less durable which consume more power. So, it is better to get a computer with SSD of greater storage.

4. Battery life
   : A computer with long battery life is extremely beneficial because it provides us longer time between each charge to complete our task. Hence, we should buy a computer with a greater battery life so that we can work on it for longer hours anywhere without worrying about the power supply.

5. Display
   : It’s the screen where we spend our most of the time looking at while using a computer. So, it is better to have a computer with a high-resolution display and if possible, display that doesn’t strain our eyes much.

6. Motherboard
   : Motherboard is the main connection point of the computer. Every connection is made through motherboard even the ports are connected to motherboard. Therefore, a good motherboard with various required ports should be considered.

7. Brand and Warranty
   : We need to make sure that we are buying our device from a trusted brad and getting a warranty of at least one year so that we can have a peace of mind.
