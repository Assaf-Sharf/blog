The Open mic session starts on Friday 14 April 2023 at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). The speaker is [Miroslav Blaško](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#miroslav-blaško) who is going to talk about insights acquired through the development and deployment of a knowledge-based system for the planning and execution of aircraft maintenance within organization Czech Airlines Technics, a.s. related to project [Improving effectiveness of aircraft maintenance planning and execution](https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/project/CK01000204).


##### The abstract

Within project [Improving effectiveness of aircraft maintenance planning and execution](https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/project/CK01000204) KBSS developed an information system that enables interactive creation of aircraft maintenance plans and a dashboard application that assesses the progress of ongoing plan executions. I will share the insights we acquired through processing and interpreting input data from the maintenance organization. I will also address the challenges we encountered when computing the actual state of the system that provided us with input data in the form of partial snapshots. Lastly, I will delve into the challenges that we faced in terms of formalizing statistics with domain experts.
