<p><p>A little over a month following the removal of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update from the Windows Update servers, Microsoft has once again released what is also known as version 1809 of its flagship desktop operating system.</p>
<p>The update, originally released at the beginning of October, <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/10/windows-10-october-2018-update-rollout-paused-due-to-file-deletion-bug" rel="nofollow">was pulled shortly after its public launch</a> due to a bug that would delete user profiles alongside their personal data (documents, music, pictures, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/11/13/resuming-the-rollout-of-the-windows-10-october-2018-update/" rel="nofollow">According to John Cable</a>, Windows Servicing and Delivery Director of Program Management, the release date for the update has been changed to November 13, 2018 for the purposes of Microsoft's 30-month timeline for service. This is for both <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/windows-10/'><img alt='Small Windows 10 icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/windows-10_82838.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Windows 10</a> and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/windows-server-2019/'><img alt='Small Windows Server 2019 icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/windows-server-2019_123104.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Windows Server 2019</a> version 1809.</p>
