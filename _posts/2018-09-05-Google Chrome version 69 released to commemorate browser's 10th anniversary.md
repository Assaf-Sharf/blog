<p>Google is releasing a major new version of its Chrome web browser for its 10th anniversary that includes a visual refresh and a slew of performance and feature improvements.</p><p>[In a Google Blog post](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/chromes-turning-10-heres-whats-new/) co-authored by Chrome's Product Management Desktop and Mobile Leads, Ellie Powers and Chris Beckmann, changes included with the latest version of Google Chrome are described. The most immediately notable change is the web browser's new, more rounded design across of of its supported desktop and mobile platforms. [According to Frederic Lardinois at TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/chrome-gets-a-new-look-for-its-10th-birthday/), this redesign adheres to Google's Material Design 2 standard. </p><p>On top of visual design enhancements (and platform-specific design optimizations, such as moving the toolbar to the bottom of https://alternativeto.net/software/ios/ devices in order to make it easier to reach), improvements to features such as autofill and password management were highlighted in Powers' and Beckmann's blog post. Autofill information, including addresses, credit card information, and passwords, can now be accessed by users in https://alternativeto.net/software/google-chrome/'s toolbar. Chrome will also be capable of generating unique per-site passwords that can be saved to a user's Google Account and accessed on any device that they are signed in to Chrome on.</p><p>In addition, Google [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF2IjH35w8o) describing new features in Chrome 69 that benefit developers, including CSS Scroll Snapping (for creating smoother scrolling for devs that want users to scroll to specific points, such as in an image carousel), support for notched smart devices, support for web locks, and support for additional CSS4 features.</p><p>This latest version of Google Chrome is launching now for all platforms and can be downloaded immediately on desktop and laptop computers.</p><p>Additional coverage:<br/>[Google Blog](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/chromes-turning-10-heres-whats-new/)<br/>[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/google-celebrates-a-decade-of-google-chrome-launches-major-redesign/)<br/>[Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/04/google-chrome-10th-birthday-release/)<br/>[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/chrome-gets-a-new-look-for-its-10th-birthday/)<br/>[VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/04/chrome-69-arrives-with-revamped-design-more-powerful-omnibox-and-better-password-manager/)<br/>[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17814516/google-chrome-new-design-features)</p>
