title: "Presidential Topic Modeling: Democrat or Republican?"
date: 2019-03-07
excerpt: "Here I take all of the State Of the Union addresses from 1790-2017, split them into sentences, tokenize (lemmatize) each sentence, infer the topics present in all text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Latent Semantic Analysis, and use doc2vec to predict if a given piece of text originates from a Democrat or a Republican."
tags: [nlp, doc2vec, deep-learning, classification, latent-dirichlet-allocation, latent-semantic-analysis]
