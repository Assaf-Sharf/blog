title: "Presidential Topic Modeling and Classification using State of the Union Addresses"
date: 2019-03-07
excerpt: "Here I had two goals: find out what latent topics were preset in all of the State Of the Union addresses since 1790 and predict which President said which sentence. Preprocessing is a crucial ingredient for natural language processings tasks and here I use part of speech tagging for tokenization/lemmatization."
tags: [nlp, cnn, deep-learning, classification, latent-dirichlet-allocation, word-embeddings]
