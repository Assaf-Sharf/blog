<p><p>SoundCloud is receiving weekly automated playlist generation based on what it believes each user wants to listen to.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.soundcloud.com/2018/09/10/discover-next-favorite-track-new-soundcloud-weekly-playlist/" rel="nofollow">a post on its official blog</a>, the music sharing network detailed how the playlists, called SoundCloud Weekly, will work.</p>
<p><a href='//alternativeto.net/software/soundcloud/'><img alt='Small SoundCloud icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/soundcloud_81844.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />SoundCloud</a> Weekly will update every Monday based on an algorithm that considers the music users have listened to, liked, and shared. This will generate recommendations for each user in the form of a playlist.</p>
<p>This feature has already started rolling out as of September 10th on <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_88776.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a>, and on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">SoundCloud's website</a>.</p>
