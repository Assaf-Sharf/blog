# File Permission and Access Modes in Unix

File ownership is an important component of Unix that provides a secure method for storing files.

Every file in Unix has the following attributes:

- Owner permissions: The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.
- Group permissions: The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
- Other (world) permissions: The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.

# The Permission Indicators

While using ls -l command, it displays various information related to file permission as follows:

- read (r), write(w), execute(x)

```
$ls -l /home/amrood
-rwxr-xr--  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  myfile
drwxr-xr--- 1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  mydir
```

| -rwxr-xr--                                                                |                                                                                          |                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| First 3 char (2-4)                                                        | Second 3 char (5-7)                                                                      | Last 3 char (8-10)                                  |
| Represent the permissions for the file's owner                            | Consist of the permissions for the group to which the file belongs                       | Represent the permissions for other (everyone else) |
| rwx                                                                       | r-x                                                                                      | r--                                                 |
| Represent that the owner has read(r), write(w), and execute(x) permission | Represent that the group has read(r), and execute(x) permission, but no write permission | Represent that there is read(r) only permission     |

# File Access Modes

The permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a Unix system.

The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the `read`, `write`, and `execute` permissions, which have been described below:

- Read: Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the contents of the file.
- Write: Grants the capability to modify, or remove the content of the file.
- Execute: User with execute permissions can run a file as a program.

# Directory Access Modes

Directory access modes are listed and organized in the same manner as any other file.

There are a few differences that need to be mentioned:

- Read: Access to a directory means that the user can read the contents. The user can look at the `filenames` inside the directory.
- Write: Access means that the user can add or delete files from the directory.
- Execute: Executing a directory doesn't really make sense, so think of this as a traverse permission. A user must have `execute` access to the `bin` directory in order to execute the `ls` or the `cd` command.

# Changing Permissions

To change the file or the directory permissions, you use the chmod (change mode) command. There are two ways to use chmod ‚Äî the symbolic mode and the absolute mode.

## Using chmod in Symbolic Mode

The easiest way for a beginner to modify file or directory permissions is to use the symbolic mode. With symbolic permissions you can add, delete, or specify the permission set you want by using the operators in the following table.

| Sr.No. | Chmod operator & Description                                             |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | \+ &rarr; Adds the designated permission(s) to a file or directory.      |
| 2      | \- &rarr; Removes the designated permission(s) from a file or directory. |
| 3      | = &rarr; Sets the designated permission(s).                              |

1. Run `ls -l` on the testfile shows that the file's permissions are as follows:
   ```
   $ls -l file
   -rwxrwxr--  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  testfile
   ```
2. Then each example chmod command from the preceding table is run on the testfile, followed by ls ‚Äìl, so you can see the permission changes:

   ```
   -- Add write and execute permissions to other
   $chmod o+wx testfile
   $ls -l testfile
   -rwxrwxrwx  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  testfile

   -- Remove execute permission from user
   $chmod u-x testfile
   $ls -l testfile
   -rw-rwxrwx  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  testfile

   -- Set only read and execute permissions(not write!) to group
   $chmod g = rx testfile
   $ls -l testfile
   -rw-r-xrwx  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  testfile
   ```

3. Combine these commands on a single line:
   ```
   -- 1. Add write and execute permissions to other
   -- 2. Remove execute permission from user
   -- 3. Set write and execute permissions to group
   $chmod o+wx,u-x,g = rx testfile
   $ls -l testfile
   -rw-r-xrwx  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  testfile
   ```
