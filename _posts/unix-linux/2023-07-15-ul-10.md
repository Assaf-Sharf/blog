# The Introduction of the vi Editor

The vi editor enables us to edit lines in context with other lines in the file.

An improved version of the vi editor which is called the `VIM` has also been made available now. VIM stands for `Vi IMproved`.

`vi` is generally considered the `de facto` standard in Unix editors because:

- It's usually available on all the flavors of Unix system.
- Its implementations are very similar across the board.
- It requires very few resources.
- It is more user-friendly than other editors such as the `ed` or the `ex`.

# Starting the vi Editor

| Command        | Description                                                                          |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| vi filename    | Creates a new file, if it already does not exist. Otherwise, opens an existing file. |
| vi -R filename | Opens an existing file in the read-only mode.                                        |
| view filename  | Opens an existing file in the read-only mode.                                        |

Create a new file 'testfile' if it already does not exist in the current working directory:

```
$vi testfile
|
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
"testfile" [New File]
```

A `tilde (~)` represents an unused line. If a line does not begin with a tilde and appears to be blank, there is a space, tab, newline, or some other non-viewable character present.

# Operation Modes

While working with the vi editor, usually come across the following two modes:

- Command mode
  : This mode enables us to perform administrative tasks such as:
  : - Saving the files
  : - Executing the commands
  : - Moving the cursor
  : - Cutting(yanking) and pasting the lines or words
  : - Finding and replacing
  : In this mode, whatever we type is interpreted as a command.
- Insert mode
