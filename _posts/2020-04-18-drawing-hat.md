Here is a drawing of my favorite hat.
The front view was my first go at it and it was very hard at
first, I tried to make it very symmetric which proved to be
difficult.
I then played around with the shape because it was hard to
draw a dome which was forward facing.

The side view was much easier because I was easily able to add
some depth .
The back view was easier than the front view since I didn't have the
cap and I had the practice from the first picture.
After this drawing I might decide to take some basic
drawing classes and see where it takes me.
I hope you all enjoy, and feel free to leave any courses you like
in the comment below.
