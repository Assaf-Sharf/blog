The Open mic session starts on Friday 12th May 2023 at 10:30 at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). Speaker [Martin Ledvinka](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#martin-ledvinka) opens the topic of SHACL-based object-ontological mapping.


##### The abstract

The [Java OWL Persistence API (JOPA)](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jopa) is by now a production-proven persistence library for Semantic Web-based information systems.
A logic-based formalism exists for its OWL (2)-based object-ontological mapping, which uses integrity constraints with closed-world semantics. However,
OWL integrity constraints never gained much traction in the industry, so most of the JOPA-based object models are written by hand and rely only on the runtime
validation provided by the library itself.

SHACL is a W3C standard for defining and validating integrity constraints on RDF graphs. Supporting SHACL-based object-ontological mapping would greatly
improve the capabilities of JOPA. This talk will discuss preliminary findings on how to define such a mapping in a formal way.
