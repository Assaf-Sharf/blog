## Learning the basics of SQL
Today, I learned few basics of SQL by solving some practice problems from HackerRank and Leetcode.
I will just list few basic knowledge of SQL that I learned here.

### My code for today
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Table1
```
This code brings all the info from the data "Table1".

```sql
SELECT Populations
FROM City
WHERE Populations > 100000
ORDER BY Populations DESC
LIMIT 1
```
This code brings the population of cities where the population exceeds 100000 from the data "City".
This data is in descending order, and it only shows one data, meaning it is the highest population.

```sql
SELECT CategoryID, SUM(Price)
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID
```
This code brings the category id and the sum of the prices from the data "Products" that are grouped by the CategoryID column.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Table1
WHERE col4 LIKE 'Qu%'
AND col3 IN ('USA', 'Korea')
AND col2 BETWEEN 5 AND 10
```
This code brings all the data from "Table1" where  column 4(col4) starts with "Qu", and column 3(col3) is either 'USA' or 'Korea', and column 2(col2) is between 5 and 10.

```sql
SELECT LEFT('20230105', 4)
--> 2023 brings the left 4 digit/string
SELECT RIGHT('20230105', 4)
--> 0105 brings the right 4 digit/string
SELECT SUBSTRING('20230105', 1, 4)
--> 2023 brings from the 1st digit/string to 4th digit/string
SELECT SUBSTRING('20230105', 4)
--> 30105 brings from the 4th digit/string to the end
SELECT CEIL(5.5)
--> 6 rounds up
SELECT FLOOR(5.5)
--> 5 rounds down
SELECT ROUND(3.14, 1)
--> 3.1 rounds to the 1st decimal point
```
These are some of the basic functions regarding managing decimals and slicing.

```sql
SELECT Id
     , CASE Id
            WHEN 1 THEN 'Red'
            WHEN 2 THEN 'Blue'
            ELSE 'Unknown'
        END AS Color
FROM Table1
```
This is a case statement that's just like the if statement.
The data shows Id and the column labeled 'Color' that says 'Red' if Id is 1, 'Blue' if Id is 2, and 'Unknown' if neither of those two numbers.

```sql
SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN CategoryId = 1 THEN Price ELSE NULL END) AS Category1_avg_price
     , AVG(CASE WHEN CategoryId = 2 THEN Price ELSE NULL END) AS Category2_avg_price
     , AVG(CASE WHEN CategoryId = 1 THEN Price ELSE NULL END) AS Category1_avg_price
FROM Products
```
This code creates a pivot table of the average price according to the category from the data "Products".

Overall, trying to write the code for the pivot table and case statement was more challenging, but fairly easy once I understood the concept.
I will need more reviews and more basic knowledges until I can be able to manage data by myself.
