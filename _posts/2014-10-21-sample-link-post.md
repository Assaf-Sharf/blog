The link in the post's title redirect you to [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/)'s [Made Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com).<br>
He is the original developer of the Minimal Mistake project and his site is going to inspire you if you are into drawing (on iPad) and design.<br>
This theme supports **link posts**, made famous by John Gruber. To use, just add `link: http://url-you-want-linked` to the post's YAML front matter and you're done.<br>
