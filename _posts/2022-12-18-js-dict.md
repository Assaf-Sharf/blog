## How to write and use dictionary in JavaScript

Today I learned how to write and use dictionary in Javascript. 
The format was similar to Python, so it was easy to get used to writing and using it.
I learned two ways to refer to value of a key in a dictionary.

1) dictionary.key
2) dictionary["key"]

Since the first method is more frequently used, I practiced using the first method.

### My code for today
I learned the format of dictionary and how to apply dictionary:
```js
const fruits = [
    {number: 1, title: "레드향"},
    {number: 2, title: "샤인머스캣"},
    {number: 3, title: "산청딸기"},
    {number: 4, title: "한라봉"},
    {number: 5, title: "사과"},
    {number: 6, title: "애플망고"},
    {number: 7, title: "딸기"},
    {number: 8, title: "천혜향"},
    {number: 9, title: "과일선물세트"},
    {number: 10, title: "귤"},
    ]

function fruitRank(start, end) {
    let rank = [];
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        rank.push(fruits[i].number + " " + fruits[i].title);
    }
    return rank;
}

fruitRank(0,5)
// (6) ['1 레드향', '2 샤인머스캣', '3 산청딸기', '4 한라봉', '5 사과', '6 애플망고']
```
I only included the part where I apply the dictionary in my fruitRank function since this also includes the format of dictionary.
Overall, I am pretty confident in using the dictionary in JavaScript, but more practice, the better I will be.
