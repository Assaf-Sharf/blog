This is a pre-announcement in anticipation of a formal award. More details
are coming soon.
{: .notice--warning}

This is a postdoc position to develop Salmonella typing and
phenotypic prediction methods from genomes and
metagenomes using population genomics and machine learning.

I anticipate that a successful applicant will have an interest or experience in
computer science, machine learning, applied math or quantitative microbial
ecology. This position focuses on the development of applications for analysis
of this data and the publication of software tools. A successful candidate will
likely have experience in version control, test driven development, data
structures, HPCâ€™s, DevOps practices and proficiency in Python. The applicant
should have a strong understanding of statistics. I recognize that each person
has a unique mix of experience and individual strengths and I encourage any
applicant with a strong record of research productivity and relevant experience
to apply, even if your mix of skills is different than what is listed above.
