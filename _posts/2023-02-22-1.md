### Loss function

![loss_func](../../images/2023-02-22-1/loss_func.png)

Generator: Deceive Discriminator( ``D(G(z))`` -> 1 )

Discriminator: Judge real or fake( ``D(x)`` -> 1, ``D(G(z))`` -> 0 )

At first, G(z) is too bad. ( D(G(z)) -> 0 )

The slope of log (1-x) at 0 is too small. But, slope of log x at 0 is good!

-  Min [ log(1-D(G(z))) ] --> Max [ log(D(G(z))) ]
