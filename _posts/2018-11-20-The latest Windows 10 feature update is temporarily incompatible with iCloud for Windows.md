<p><p>The latest Windows 10 update has been rereleased since being pulled last month, and despite Microsoft touting its bug-free nature, iCloud users attempting to run the latest version of the software for Windows have been met with an unpleasant time.</p>
<p>Here is the official statement from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/18/icloud-windows-10-october-update-bug/" rel="nofollow">the Windows Help page detailing Windows 10's update history</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple has identified an incompatibility with iCloud for Windows (version 7.7.0.27) where users may experience issues updating or synching Shared Albums after updating to Windows 10, version 1809.<br />
Users who attempt to install iCloud for Windows (version 7.7.0.27) on Windows 10, version 1809 will see a message stating that this version of iCloud for Windows isnâ€™t supported, and the installation will fail.<br />
To ensure a seamless experience, Microsoft is blocking devices with iCloud for Windows (version 7.7.0.27) software installed from being offered Window 10, version 1809 until this issue has been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, Microsoft &quot;is working with Apple to provide a compatible version of <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/icloud/'><img alt='Small iCloud icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/icloud_97667.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iCloud</a> for Windows 10, version 1809 in an upcoming release.&quot; The company recommends not manually updating their version of Windows 10 to 1809 until this issue is resolved if they wish to continue using iCloud.</p>
