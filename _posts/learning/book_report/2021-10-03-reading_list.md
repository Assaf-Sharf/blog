    1.  When David Goggins dies, he will have to have a conversation with Victor Herman to determine who is the toughest human being to have ever lived.
        
2.  _Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader_ by Herminia Ibarra
    
    1.  NA - 06/08/21
        
3.  [_**The Mastery of Love**_](/categories/learning/book_report/the_mastery_of_love) by Don Miguel Ruiz
    
    1.  05/26/21 - 09/30/21
        
4.  _The Art of War_ by Sun Tzu
    
    1.  NA - 10/06/21
        
5.  [_**Can't Hurt Me**_](/categories/learning/book_report/cant_hurt_me)  by David Goggins
    
    1.  10/06/21 - 10/17/21
        
6.  _Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage_ by Alfred Lansing
    
    1.  10/18/21 - 10/27/21
        
    2.  A phenomenal story that seems almost unreal. I listened to the audiobook and I was taken away. The story requires some time to build up, but halfway through you can truly see, feel and emphasize what the sailors are experiencing. It has moments that will make your stomach turn and make you yell at God for his cruelty. It also has moments of satisfaction where youâ€™re laughing and giggling. Overall, this is truly an extraordinary book that I would highly recommend.
        
7.  _The Outsider_ by S. E. Hinton
    
    1.  NA - 10/31/2021
        
8.  [_12 Rules for Life_](/categories/learning/book_report/12_rules_for_life)  by Jordan Peterson
    
    1.  01/19/21 - 11/03/21
        
9.  _An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything_ by Chris Hadfield
    
    1.  10/28/21 - 11/09/21
        
10.  _The Daily Laws: 366 Meditations on Power, Seduction, Mastery, Strategy, and Human Nature_ by Robert Greene - **[In Progress]**
    
	    1.  11/01/21 - TBD
        
11.  _Oedipus_ the King by Sophocles
    
	    1.  11/04/21 - 11/15/21
        
12.  The President and the Freedom Fighter
    
	    1.  A moving book about the life and work of Abraham Lincoln and Fredrick Douglas. Two unlikely friends in a critical time of American History. An accurate account of the two men, not glorifying them, instead truthfully outlining their actions, feelings, and views at various points in their lives. I was honestly more touched and moved by the life of Fredrick Douglas, a man who was born a slave, yet died a legend.
