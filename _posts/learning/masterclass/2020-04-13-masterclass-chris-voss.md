In this post, I will be taking note of Chris Voss's
[Master Class](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation/).
I will do my best to add each lecture here.
As you might notice I did not start note taking this
[Lecture 3, Labeling]({{site.url}}/{{page.url}}/#labeling).
The purpose of these notes are mainly personal, I would like to
be able to look at them and remember some key lessons that I learned.
If you are also going through the series, feel free to use them as
a template and add more content.

# Empathy
- Understanding the rules that the other team is playing by
- You don't need to agree with those rules but you have to grasp them
- Understand them and play by those rules.
- Play their game


# Mirroring
-  Let people talk
-  Pick the last 1-3 words and say them back to the person, phrased as a question
-  People want to be heard, keep asking them questions about what they are saying and they will start to think they are part of the
negotiation.
-  By the end of the questions you ask them, they will be more
open to what you initially said.
-  This is an art which takes lots of practice, don't be discouraged.
Do keep trying. Let people do all the talking, and ask for further
explanation. They will love you for it.


# Labeling
- Amygdala is the emotional center of the brain.
- When showing people pictures that incurred negative emotions,
they were able to see the effect on the amygdala.
- When asking those people to label how they felt after seeing those
negative pictures, they saw that the level of negativity on the
amygdala decreased.
- If you identify a negative emotion someone might be having, such
as feeling angry, and you label it as such, it help the person
reduce that negative emotion.
- A very useful tool with various application, don't be fooled by the simplicity.
- Steps of Labeling:
  1. Being aware of what the other person is feeling.
     1. This is usually easy and your gut will walk you through it.
  2. Simply label:
     - It seems like ...
     - It sounds like ...
     - I don't want you to get upset about this...
     - By labeling something you can establish repore
     with the other person, you can gain insight to what they are
     thinking, and it helps you increase your influence.
       - Trust-based influence:
         - Lowest maintenance and durable type of influence there is.
- Incorrect way to label something
  - What I am hearing is ...
    - Dropped the word "I", meaning that I care more about my
    perspective.
  - Resist the urge to label a good label.
  - Try not to talk after a good label, let it sit on the other side.
  Take the effect that you want it to. Let it sync it.
- Going to take more than one label to defuse the negative.
- Labels will help defuse the negative, but the degree varies.
  - Some labels will hit harder and help you gain more influence than others.
- If you label an emotion and the response you receive is silence,
it doesn't mean that your label isn't good, it means that you just
need more.
  - Label it some more, add some comments.
    - "Sounds like I haven't gone far enough"
    - "Sounds like there's more than meets the eye"
    - "Sounds like there's some feelings about this that I haven't quite touched yet.
- Labeling a negative deactivates a negative, but labeling a positive reinforces it.
  - Telling others you appreciate how generous they are being with
  their time (Customer service).
  - If someone thinks that they're being generous with their time,
  feed that, reinforce that emotion. It will help your influence.
- Mirrors are a great way to dye yourself in with labels.
- A combination of mirrors leading to a label can be very successful.
  - Using several mirrors will help you tease out an emotion
  that the other side might be having, for you to label.
- You can mirror the response to a label, and get a lot more information afterward.
## Exercise
- Labels don't have to be emotions (sad, angry, happy),
they can also be things that someone enjoys.
  - Sounds like you like {puzzles, drama, people}
- You might have some awkward labels, but sometimes people might be
  okay with talking about that.
- The other person can explore a label and how they feel about it.
- The other person feels heard.
- You let the other side say all that they want without knowing a single
thing about you.
- __Not a single question was asked__, mirroring and labeling allow the
other person to keep talking without constantly asking them questions.

# Mastering Delivery
- Your inner voice betrays your outer voice
- Your tone gives away a lot, your voice, your delivery, speaks
volumes
  -   It conveys Deference (humble submission and respect.)
  - It can convey genuineness.
- Some hostage negotiators might not say the right thing, but they say it in the right voice. Which is better than someone saying
the right things in the wrong voice.
## Manipulate Mirror Neurons
- If you can see someone and speak to them, you are in a position to
hit their mirror neurons.
- If I am angry you'll get angry too.
  - Involuntary response
- Use the Late-night FM DJ voice (nice slow calm voice).
This can help slow down the other person's train of thought.
  - Calms people down.
  - Can't tell people to calm down, that's an order and people hate that.
  - Instead hit them with that calm voice and add a smile.
- Smile when you talk to people, positively hit their mirror neurons.
  - Don't be held hostage by whether they like you.
  - Calm them down, hit their mirror neurons with a smile.
  - Give them a reason to like you and see that collaborating with
you is worth their time.

## Tones of Voice
### Ditch the "Assertive" Voice
- The fight type, assertive, blunt.
- Direct and Honest
- It makes people feel like they're being punched in the nose.
- Anger always leaves a negative residue and is bad for
long-term relationships.
- Counterproductive

### Use the "Playful" Voice
- The accommodator's voice, the playful voice.
- Say it in a way that keeps the relationship, but
presents it in an honest way
- Make people feel like they're not backed into a corner.
- Letting people know that you have to tell the truth, but making sure it lands softly.
- The "straight shooter", everyone loves somebody who will tell the truth, as long as they are worried about how it lands.
- Use this voice about 80%, keep people in a positive state of mind,
keeps them working with you.

### Use the "Analyst" Voice
- Downward, slow, soothing tone which is declarative.
- Use this when you have to throw something out with is immovable.
- Make sure to be slow, and whatever your saying better be immovable.
- Use this voice rarely, the other side will feel code.
The other side will not like this voice.

### Use the "Late-Night FM DJ" Voice
- the difference between this and the Analyst is that the Analyst
voice lacks warmth.
- Use this voice no more than 10-15% of the time.
- Situation, when the other side is upset, it is a quick way to calm them down.
- If the other side is anxious all the time, this voice will calm
them down quickly

### Inflections
- This is where you start adding the mastery, facts.
- Use an inquisitive tone of voice, which is genuine and curious
at the end

## Digital Communication
- Don't over-rely on any one form of Communication.
- Don't make them too long, always end positively.
- Would you play Cheese in an email?
  - Use different forms of Communications for each move.
  - Emails naturally sound negative so try to soften them.
