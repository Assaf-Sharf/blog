# [Biological Influences On Sex, Sex Differences & Preferences | Huberman Lab Podcast #14](https://youtu.be/J7SrAEacyf8)

## Basic Components

-   Hormones affect the brain and spinal cord, which affect the body.

-   Hormones are a substance released from an area of the body (glands, neurons) that travel and affect themselves and other parts of the body.

-   Gonadal sex

    -   testies - male

    -   ovaries - female

-   Within the XY chromones, the Y chromosome suppresses ovaries' development.

-   There is a significant distinction between chromosomal sex and gonadal sex.

-   Hormonal sex - Affects of estrogen and testosterone on the Morphological sex.

-   Morphological sex - The physical characteristics of the fetus.

-   Hormones can be fast or slow

    -   Cortosl or Adrenalin - Fast

    -   Testosterone or Estegoen - Slow/Fast

-   Demasculation and defeminisation is an important component to masculisation and feminisation.


## Testosterone and Dihydrotestosterone

-   Primary sexual characteristics (genitalia)

    -   Testerone is not responsible for creating the "correct" genitalia

    -   Dihydrateststorone has powerful effects on the embryo.

        -   Responsible for the onset of penis growth.

-   Secondary characteristics

    -   In puberty, testosterone is produced by kisspeptin.

    -   Growing facial hair, larger penis, etc.

-   The masculinization of the brain is not achieved testosterone

-   Testosterone can be converted to estrogen by aromatase (enzyme).

    -   This happens later in life for boys; they can develop breast buds.

-   It is estrogen that gets created by testosterone which masculinizes the male brain.


## Protocols

-   The environment can have a profound effect on testosterone and estrogen.

-   Evening Primrose oil can increase estrogen levels in males and females.

-   Atrazine can have several testicular abnormalities.

    -   On the gonads themselves (testes)

-   Male sperm count and volumes have decreased in the US and western Europe.

-   These herbicides are drastically affecting estrogen and testosterone.


## Female Development

-   Androgen insensitivity disorder

    -   Having XY chromosomes, but they appear female.

    -   These are profound effects of testosterone and development.


## Variables for Developments

-   Marijuana

    -   THC and other chemicals in cannabis increase aromatase activity (**BAD**).

    -   Pot smokers have higher chances of having Gyno

    -   Increases estrogen

    -   In pregnant women, it can promote estrogen circulation and inhibit the masculinization of the brain.

-   Estrogen is essential for both males and females for sexual activities.

-   Alcohol

    -   Not suitable to drink during pregnancy.

    -   Alchohol and grain alcohol can increase estrogen activities.

        -   Particularly in teenagers.

-   Cell Phones

    -   No quality studies indicate that holding a cell phone to the head is bad for the brain.

    -   Cell phones near the gonads can have abnormal effects on the gonads.

    -   Decreases in cortisol, thyroid, testosterone, and prolactin.

    -   It might be a good idea not to have your phone in your pocket.


## External Components

-   Dihydrotestosterone is responsible for

    -   Promotes facial hair growth

    -   Decreases hair on your head.

    -   Aggression in men

    -   Lots of effects on male

-   Creatine can inhibit DHT –> testosterone.

-   Speed of entry and exit of puberty is an exciting metric for growth and development.

-   Plants have found a way to increase estrogen to keep the population of the animals that eat them low.


## Effects of Hormones in Utero

-   Young ears in males make more sounds than females.

    -   Females that self-report as lesbians make more auto acoustic emissions than straight females.

-   Gay men tend to have higher testosterone than straight males.

-   Finger length ratios of men and females can indicate sexual preferences

    -   D2 - D4 ratio is more significant in females than males on the right hand (average).

    -   The more androgen you are exposed to in utero, the ratio is lower.

    -   Gay men can have an average or hyper-masculine D2 - D4 ratio.

    -   Lesbians can have a smaller D2 - D4 ratio.

    -   Just a window of androgen exposure during utero.

-   Brain difference for people who report homosexuality in a part of the hypothalamus.

-   Probability of males reporting as homosexual increases with the number of older brothers they have.


# [The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen | Huberman Lab Podcast #15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk)

-   Salutogenisis - Taking steps to better your health instead of avoiding the negative implication.

    -   A mental model for moving towards wellness and mindfulness.

    -   Keeping in mind, the positive effects of our actions increase their benefits.

-   The ratio of estrogen and testosterone has effects on our day-to-day lives.

-   Different glands produce hormones

    -   Gonads create sex hormones

-   Enzymes play a part, too, especially aromatase

    -   For men, excess testosterone is converted to estrogen via aromatase

-   Women produce low estrogen before puberty, then a significant spike during and post-puberty, estrogen levels cycle based on menstruation, and they decrease during menopause (age 45-60).

-   Men produce low testosterone pre-puberty, then it skyrockets, post-puberty it comes down 1% a year, although this data can vary. Some men in their 90s have the same testosterone levels are boys during puberty.

-   Adrenals produce testosterone and estrogen.


## Competition

-   Most males in most mammalian species don't get the opportunity to reproduce. There is a direct correlation between testosterone and its access to females.

    -   More testosterone == More access to females.

-   Males with higher testosterone will fight harder and longer for access to females.

-   Amygdala is used for threat detection.

    -   Testosterone binds to the amygdala and lowers the threshold of stress and anxiety (primarily in men).

-   More testosterone == more novelty-seeking, competition, and foraging.

-   The competition itself can increase testosterone.

-   Winning promotes more dopamine which increases testosterone, and the opposite is true.

-   But competition itself will increase testosterone.


## Testosterone and Estrogen for Libido

-   An increase in testosterone within females will increase their libido.

-   In females

    -   Testosterone promotes the seeking of sex

    -   Estrogen encourages the action of having sex

-   In males

    -   Testosterone encourages the seeking of sex

    -   Estrogen in males is essential for libido. Testosterone without estrogen will lower libido.

-   Sex itself promotes testosterone… kind of.

-   Prolactin after ejaculation decreases libido.

-   Sexual behavior itself can increase testosterone.

    -   Ejaculation will not decrease testosterone. But it will increase prolactin

    -   Sex without ejaculation in males for a week or more will increase testosterone by up to 400%

-   DHEA will increase both testosterone and estrogen.


## Behaviors that Decrease Testosterone

-   Becoming a parent decreases testosterone for expecting children.

    -   Expecting fathers have 50% less testosterone, double estrogen, 3x less cortisol.

        -   Due to an increase in prolactin

    -   The thought is that your body produces more fat when you become a parent to prepare for long sleepless nights.

    -   The availability of parents will affect their testosterone.

        -   Increases in testosterone and estrogen are associated with wanting to seek sex.

        -   Decreases in testosterone and estrogen are associated with not wanting sex, AKA parenting.

-   Illness

    -   Inflammatory cytokine - IL-6 will decrease sexual desire.


## Behavior Practices for Modulating Sex Steroid Hormones

### Pheromones

-   Why can behaviors affect hormones?

    -   Smell (possibly pheromone) can affect hormones in humans.

-   Many studies within animals can see their effects on their pheromones.

    -   Urine, smell, etc...

-   Sweat and pheromone of human females can modulate the menstruation of other females.

-   Girlfriends can detect their boyfriend's t-shirts that have been washed.


### Apnea

-   Apnea - Under breathing and build-up of carbon dioxide

    -   Plays an effect on lower estrogen and testosterone levels based on age averages.

-   Mostly sleep apnea

    -   People hold their breath when sleeping and then suddenly wake up.

-   Patterns of breathing can moderate hormones.

-   People who are obese are usually affected by apnea.

-   Nose breathing is better, period.

    -   Better looking face and jaw.

    -   Promotes the positive gas exchange

    -   Moderate neuromodulators and hormones

    -   It can make you a better sleeper.

-   Good Breathing → Good Sleep → Good Hormone affects.

    -   Good sleep decreases cortisol during sleep, which increases testosterone and estrogen.

    -   Getting breathing right during waking hours and during sleep decreases cortisol, increasing testosterone and estrogen.

-   Taping your mouth shut can help you be a nose breather during sleep.

-   Breathe more using your nose, and you'll get better at it.

    -   This will open up your sinuses over the long run.


### Light

-   Bright lights during wakefulness.

-   Light viewing effects have hormonal effects on many things.

-   Seasonal breeding animals

    -   The color of fur relates to the tendency to breed.

    -   Many pathways that are related to dopamine releases are related to skin pigmentation.

        -   Animals breed more during summer and spring, less during fall and winter.

        -   They are also seen in humans, happier in summer and spring because of more summer.

    -   Increase viewing of sunlight → Increase dopamine in the brain → Increase pigment in the skin and hair which also increase testosterone and estrogen → More sex

-   If you want to optimize testosterone and estrogen, get bright light for 2-10 minutes at the start of the day.

    -   Increases dopamine

-   No bright light intake in the middle of the light.

    -   Decreases dopamine, estrogen, and testosterone.


### Temperature

-   Temperature and day length are related (sunlight)

-   Cold, ice showers can increase testosterone

    -   Cooling the neurons which control vascular restriction

    -   When the gonads warm up again, they receive a rebound amount of hormones which create more testosterone.

-   The vascular system is controlled by neuron


## Exercise

-   Heavy weight training but not training until failure will have the greatest testosterone increase

    -   1-6 Reps

-   Endurance activity → Weight training

    -   The endurance activity will decrease testosterone for the weight training.

-   Weight training → Endurance activity is the way to go

-   High intense endurance workout will increase testosterone

    -   More than 75 minutes of high-intensity cardio will lower testosterone.


## Estrogen & Menopause

-   Menopause is very disruptive

    -   Mood swings, headaches, etc...

-   Black cohosh - A substance to increase estrogen (minor)

    -   modest decreases in menopause symptoms

-   Various substances are being explored to decrease the effects of menopause symptoms.


## Nutrients That Optimize the Foundation for Hormones

-   Vitamin D, Zinc, Magnesium

    -   Deficiencies in these can negatively impact libido and sex hormones.

-   Opioids are terrible for sex hormones.


## Supplements/Steriods

-   Creatine can increase DHT.

    -   It can cause baldness because of the increase in DHT

-   Boron is sometimes used as well

-   Ecdysteroids

    -   Banned substances which are very powerful, similar to androgens.


## Cancers

-   Too much testosterone and estrogen can harm sex organs. Too much androgen can cause cancer.


## Brain Optimizing Hormones

-   Luteinizing hormones

    -   Created in the pituitary gland and travels to the gonads

    -   Can increase fertility

    -   Fadogia agrestis

        -   A supplement that can increase luteinizing hormones

-   You want to make sure everything is balanced and in the correct ratios. Be careful when trying to modify things.


# [How Our Hormones Control Our Hunger, Eating & Satiety | Huberman Lab Podcast #16](https://youtu.be/17O5mgXZ9ZU)

## Basics

-   Hormones don't control appetite alone; they work closely with the nervous system.

-   Hypothalamus does a lot of things

    -   Sex, circadian rhythm

-   Ventromedial Hypothamelus - Disruptions can make people hungry or not want to eat.

    -   Insular Cortex

        -   Powerful control regarding how you feel about what you are eating

        -   The mouth does this.

        -   Some people love chewing.

        -   There are more touch tactile sensors in the mouth.


## Arcuate Nucleus

-   This part of the brain releases accelerators for feeding, appetite, or breaks.

-   PMOC neurons

    -   Creates Alpha MSH - This reduced appetite and is a potent molecule. This goes up once we have eaten.

    -   agRP neurons - Stimulates eating. This goes up when people haven't eaten for a while

        -   If you decrease these neurons, people won’t eat.

        -   If you increase these neurons, people will eat like crazy.


### Alpha MSH - Makes Us Want to Eat Less

-   Activated by ultraviolet light to the light.

    -   Keeps appetite in check.

    -   People in spring and summer eat less.

    -   Sunlight to the eyes signals MSH, and MSH can bind its receptors. This allows us to control our hunger.

-   Some people inject MSH - Not advised

    -   Reduces appetite.

    -   Makes people tanned

    -   Sends libido through the roof

        -   Cronic erections


## Ghrelin - Makes Us Want to Eat More

-   Released from the GI tract to increase your desire to eat.

    -   Stimulates parts of your brain that make you want to eat.

    -   Stimulates parts of your system to anticipate food coming in.

-   Ghrelin is like a clock for eating at specific times of the day.

    -   It uses glucose to do this.

    -   If glucose is too low, ghrelin is released.

-   Ghrelin secretion will match when your usual eating patterns

    -   It does this by syncing the clock in your liver with the clock in your hypothalamus.

    -   It is used to motivate you to eat at your scheduled time.

-   Ghrelin stimulates the agRP neurons.


### Intermittent Fasting

-   Satchin Panda has done a lot of work in this field and deserves a lot of credit.

    -   He wrote a great book called the Circadian code.

-   We can exercise on an empty stomach just fine.

-   Ghrelin secretion, on average, can be shifted by about 45 minutes per day.

    -   Some people have more willpower.

    -   If you want to shift your feeding window, you can try to shift it for about 45 minutes each day until you reach your goal. Or you can just take the dive.

-   Some people keep their ghrelin system shocked.

-   Belief and willpower are very powerful.

-   Regular eating means regular secretion of ghrelin, leading to regular feelings of hunger.


## CCK (Cholecystokinin)

-   Potent in reducing our levels of hunger.

-   When leased at normal by your gut has powerful effects for surprising appetite.

-   The GI tract releases CCK

    -   Simulated by fatty acids, amino acids, and sugar.

    -   Fatty acids

        -   Omega-3

        -   CLA

    -   Amino Acids

        -   We are eating for amino acids

        -   If we get the proper amount of amino acids, we don’t overeat.

-   When we eat, we eat for fats and amino acids.

    -   Most people will stop feeling hungry when they get the proper amount of fats and amino acids.

        -   Other reasons we will stop eating.

-   Glutamine

    -   An essential amino acid for releasing CCK.

    -   Supplementing with glutamine can reduce sugar craving.

    -   It can also increase blood sugar.

-   CCK helps decrease agRP


## Things to Avoid

-   Avoid highly processed food.

-   Dr. Robert Lustig has a great talk on the history of processed food.


### Emulsifiers

-   Lots of emulsifiers in processed foods. These emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions to occur, increasing the shelf life of many processed foods.

-   Emulsifiers in food strip the mucosal lining of the gut. This causes the neurons that innervate the gut to retract deeper in the gut.

    -   This prevents the release of CCK.

    -   If you try to eat non-processed foods afterward, your body is not as good at identifying the amino acids in them.

    -   **Emulsifiers do actual structural damage at a micro level to the gut**.

        -   This can be repaired if we stay away from processed food.

-   Emulsifiers from highly processed foods limit your gut's ability to detect what's in the food you eat and therefore deploy the satiety signals (the signals that shut down hunger).

-   Neurons in the gut sense sugar and send signals to the vegas nerve, creating dopamine.

    -   Messing up your gut's ability to sense sugar is no good.

-   Try to stay away from highly processed foods.


#### A Calorie is **Not** a Calorie

-   People lost the same amount of weight regardless of their diet, as long as they stuck to their diet (omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, carnivore, etc.)

-   Adherence is critical in determining if a plan is going to work.

-   A study of people who ate processed food and non-processed food, but the same amount of calories, had negative effects on the people who ate processed food.


## Insulin/Glucose

-   Shuttles glucose to where it needs to go.

-   High levels of glucose can kill neurons

-   We want to manage our glucose.


### Foods We Eat

-   Carbs –> Glucose goes up

-   Fats → Glucose goes up (less than carbs)

-   Proteins → Glucose goes up but then evens out.

-   Glucagon - A hormone that is secreted when you are hungry

    -   Pull stores of energy from the liver and muscles. When that energy is depleted, you will tap into body fat.

-   Insulin system managing glucose

-   Order of what you eat impacts glucose increases

    -   Carbs at the start of the meal sharply increase glucose, promoting hunger.

    -   Fibers first will blunt the release of glucose. But it will also blunt the effects of increases in glucose from carbs.

    -   If you are starving, it's OK to eat carbs first or mix everything up.

    -   If you want a modest increase in glucose or blunt the increase in glucose, eat the fibrous food first.

        -   You will reach satiety faster.

-   Alcohol will increase blood sugar.


### Movement

-   Blood sugar can be modulated by moving.

-   If you get movement before eating, your glucose will not increase as dramatically.

-   Walking after the meal will also help blunt the levels of glucose.


### Stable Blood Sugar

-   Some people can go a long time without eating and still have stable blood sugar.

-   Exercise, particularly zone two exercises, 30 - 60 minutes, can positively affect managing blood sugar levels.

-   High-intensity interval training will help with the repackaging of glucose to glycogen.

-   An extended period of positive effects post-workout.


## Fats/Lipids

-   LDL/HDL

    -   LDL - You don't want it to be too high

    -   HDL - These are good.

-   Fats don’t like water.

    -   HDL and LDL coat fats to get to where they need to be.

    -   HDL allows fats to where they need to be.

    -   High LDL will prevent fats from getting to where they need to be.

-   Keeping LDL/HDL in a ratio

    -   Consuming too much sugar can negatively impact this ratio.


## Prescription Compounds

-   Metformin

    -   Reduces blood glucose by changing mitochondrial action in the liver via the AMPK pathway. It increases insulin activity overall.

    -   Many people seek it out who are non-diabetic.

        -   Can make people hypoglycemic

-   Berberine - Poor man's metformin

    -   Not a prescription drug

    -   Mimics metformin

    -   It comes from tree bark

    -   Very powerful, which also works through the AMPK pathway.

    -   Dosages are typically higher than needed.

        -   It can make you hypoglycemic.

        -   Can causes headaches

    -   Can murder canker sores.

-   AMPK activates a pathway associated with fasting and low blood glucose.

-   Chromium

    -   Minor effects in reducing blood glucose

-   Caffeine

    -   Increases blood glucose just a little bit.

-   Magnesium

    -   A modest reduction in blood glucose

-   Stevia

    -   Lower blood glucose slightly.

    -   Unsure if Stevia impacts the gut microbiome

-   Acids

    -   Lemons, lime, apple cider vinegar - lower blood glucose

-   Many things will lower blood sugar.


## Ketogenic Diet

-   Twenty-two studies indicate the thyroid’s ability to digest carbs after a long time of being in ketosis.


## Diabetes and Urine

-   Diabetes has been known since 1500 BC.

-   Ants noticed “diabetes” in people's urine and didn't drink it.

-   Your urine is filtered blood.

-   Until 1674 people were measuring blood glucose in urine by tasting it.


## Yerba Mate

-   Increases GLP1 and increases leptin levels.

-   Glucagon is the opposite of insulin.

-   GLP1 is an appetite suppressant, gives you alertness, provides electrolytes.

-   Useful for fasting.


## Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

-   High estrogen decreases appetite

-   High testosterone increases appetite.
