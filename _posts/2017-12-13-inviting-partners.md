## Introduction
This document helps you understand how to invite your trading partners to connect with you.

### Step One
To invite a partner, you will need their email address and a price list to assign them. In order to invite a partner, you need to create the partner in the Convictional admin under partners:
![createPartner](https://github.com/rogerkirkness/convictional-help/blob/master/assets/images/createPartner.png?raw=true)

#### Fields
* Code: a code for the partner, enter anything you want here
* Email: the email address for your partner to receive the invite
* Price List: the price list you want to assign your partner
* Relationship: is this a drop shipping partner? Use 'child'

### Step Two
Once you have all the fields completed, you can click submit. A partner will be created in the Convictional system that you can manage through the API or admin. Now you need to invite them.

On the partners screen there is a link you can click to invite your partner. Click that link when you are ready to send them an invite to connect with you:

### Step Three
Once you click invite, we will send them an email with a link to sign up and connect with you. You can see the status of their invitation and whether the invite has been sent on their record.

We recommend that you only activate partners after they are signed up and connected with you. This allows you to ensure you have all the information you need to start trading with them.
