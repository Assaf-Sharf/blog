Convictional connects you to your trading partners or other shops. In this help doc we will help you learn how to invite a partner or shop and connect them to you.

In order to invite a partner, you need some information: 
* The email for the partner (or your own if it is your shop)
* The Shopify Shop Name
* The price list (optional) you want to assign them to

Typically you already have an email for your trading partner. Getting the shop name is pretty easy if you know the URL of their store. 

Go to your partners store (or your own if connecting your own shop) and add "/admin" to the end of the URL. A new URL for the store will appear in the format: shop.myshopify.com.

You want everything before .myshopify.com in the URL (ie. "shop"). Here is a picture. 
![shop-name](https://github.com/rogerkirkness/convictional-help/blob/master/assets/images/shop-name.png?raw=true)

Copy/paste that into the Shopify Shop Name field when you are setting up a partner.

Once you have done that, click Create Partner. Next, click "Invite" on their record in the partner master. This will send them an email with a link to sign up and connect their shop.
