## Young Park

Hi, my name is Young Park.

I'm taking Software Engineering (AI) program at Centennial College, Toronto.

Especially I'm interested in data science/machine learning engineering field.

I like to take pictures in B/W.

I recently started home training.. I hope it would work this time.
