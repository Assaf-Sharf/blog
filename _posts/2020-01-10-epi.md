We arrived!

The University of Florida [Emerging Pathogens Institute](http://www.epi.ufl.edu/) has graciously provided
space for our USDA group the biomathematics wing of EPI.  The Institute has a unique, integrated focus on animal, plant and human health.  The move gives lab members the opportunity to interact with microbiologists and statisticians working on many agriculturally relevant projects.
