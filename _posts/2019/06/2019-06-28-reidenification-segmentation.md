## Abstract:

> In this paper, a method for improving the quality of person re-identification results is presented. The method is based on the assumption, that including segmentation information into re-identification pipeline discards the automated detections that are of poor quality due to occlusions, misplaced regions of interest (ROI), multiple persons found within a single ROI, etc. using a simple segment number, bounding box fill rate and aspect ratio check. Assuming that a joint detector-segmented approach is used, the additional cost associated with the use of the proposed approach is very low.
