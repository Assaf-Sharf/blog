A few days ago I got some React examples working. I had been trying to get things going in linux
as a virtual machine, on the assumption that it would be more complicated on other systems.
But installing and getting things working in Windows turned out to be painless and with the git powershell
it should be easy to sync up to Github as well.

I completed the first chapters of https://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react and have gone back to the official facebook tutorials
to try and cement the things I've learned so far.

Currently getting some [TicTacToe](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) up and running.
