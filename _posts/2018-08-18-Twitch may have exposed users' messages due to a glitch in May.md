<p>A now-discontinued feature may have been a source of private data being exposed on one of the most popular live streaming websites.</p><p>https://alternativeto.net/software/twitch/ discontinued its messages feature in May. When it did so, it offered users to download copies of their data. However, a bug might have caused user data to be placed in the wrong archives.</p><p>In a statement [made to Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/17/17715236/twitch-messages-glitch-archive-download), a representative for Twitch stated the following:<br/>> In May, we removed a legacy feature called Messages and provided users the ability to download an archive of past messages. Due to a bug in the code that generated the message archive files, which has since been fixed, a small percentage of user messages were included in the wrong archives. The primary use case for Messages was promotion; streamers sending out mass communication to subscribers for example, and the majority of messages that were unintentionally provided to another user fall into that category. We have notified users via email and provided them the affected messages for review. Protecting our usersâ€™ privacy is important to us and we have taken actions to ensure this kind of error does not happen in the future.</p><p>In addition to emailing users potentially impacted by this breach, Twitch has also [set up a web portal](https://www.twitch.tv/messages/archive) in order to verify if users have or have not been affected.</p>
