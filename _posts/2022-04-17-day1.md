# Day 1. Introduction

On `day 1`, I learned the basics of the basics of JavaScript. I have written some notes on my notebook, and this post will have some features that I think are important to remember.

### 1. console.log()

+ can take multiple arguments
+ the arguments are strings(texts)
  + single quotes(' '), double quotes(" "), back-ticks(``)

### 2. Comments

+ single line comment
```js
// this is a single line comment.
```

+ multiline comment
```js
/*
you can put multiple lines of comments
using these symbols 
*/
```

### 3. Arithmetics

On console(how to open:`Ctrl+Shift+I`), I can use these operators without `console.log`, but in text editor I should use `console.log`.

+ multiplication(*)
+ division(/)
+ addition(+)
+ subtraction(-)
+ modulus(%) - finding remainder
+ exponentation(**) ex) 3 ** 2 = 9

### 4. Adding Javascript to a web page

##### 1) Inline script
  ```html
  <body>
    <button onclick = "alert('Welcome!')">Click me<button>
  </body>
  ```
<br>

##### 2) Internal script
  + could be written in both head/**body**
```html
<script>
  console.log('Welcome!');
</script>
```
<br>

##### 3) External script *(create an external JavaScript file)*
  + could be written in both head/**body**
```html
<body>
  <script src = "introduction.js"></script>
</body>
```
  + before the closing tag(`</body>`) is recommended place to put JavaScript code
<br>

##### 4) Multiple external scripts
  + you can add several JS files
  + ⚠️your main.js file should be **below** all other scripts(should be written last)

<br>

### 5. Introduction to Data Types

+ **Primitive Types**
  + Numbers - both integers(-,0,+) and float-point numbers
  + Strings - any data types under ' ', " ", ``
  + Boolean - true / false
  + undefined 
    + default value if we don't assign any value to a variable
    + if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined
  + null - an empty value

<br>

### 6. Variables
