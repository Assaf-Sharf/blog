<p><p>Adobe has officially announced the full Adobe Photoshop application will be released on iPad, as well as its plans to release the professional image editing software on operating systems and form factors that have previously never received the full version.</p>
<p>Originally revealed <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/7/adobe-is-developing-a-full-version-of-photoshop-for-ipad" rel="nofollow">back in July</a>, this release of Photoshop on the iPad will be able to edit the same PSD files with the same toolset and operations from the desktop release of the application. This is the result of work following the proposal of two engineers working on Photoshop at Adobe that desired to run Photoshop on iPad with its original code.</p>
<p>Photoshop's signature PSD files will be able to synchronize with both the desktop and iPad release of Photoshop seamlessly, with the benefits of the iPad release highlighted by Adobe including increased mobility, touch support, and support for Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>More bullet points were shared on <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-photoshop-aero-gemini-dimension-photoshop-cc/" rel="nofollow">the official announcement blog post</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It shares the same code base as its desktop counterpart, so there’s no compromises on power and performance or editing results.</li>
<li>Creative work you do in Photoshop on the desktop you can also do on your iPad, with the exact same PSD files with the edits right where you left off. We will release a smaller set of features on the iPad first so we can ship the 1.0 version to you quickly, and gradually add the rest over time.</li>
<li>When you open it, you’ll find a toolbar with the core iconic tools and powerful layer system for advanced control. You’ll also find selections and masking, filters, adjustments, and much more.</li>
<li>But we’re completely rethinking the user experience for a modern touch device. You’ll find it familiar, but also adapted in smart ways for the device.</li>
<li>We’ve designed Photoshop on iPad with natural touch gestures in mind to speed up workflows.</li>
</ul>
