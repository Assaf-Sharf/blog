### The Agricultural microbiomes group has funds available for summer research appointments

We have several potential interesting projects for students with an interest in
machine learning, agriculture or microbiome science.  Applicants should have
some experience programming or scripting, preferably in Python, R, or Javascript.

* Developing a model to update frost free dates to take into account climate
change and create a web application to help growers use the data to time the
planting of crops.

* Develop a Vue.js/mongoDB/Flask web application to visualize sequencing quality control data
