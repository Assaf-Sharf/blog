Happy Bi Visibility Day üíñüíúüíô

[Register](https://events.zoom.us/e/view/uRODlDU3TW2PtXCi_QQN5A) for my speech on Saturday, September 25 at 11:30am Pacific Time! (session: Lightning Talks 4)

This year, this day is especially important to me for two reasons. First, my dear friend Jan Bambach offered me the opportunity to be a [guest writer](https://www.vielbunt.org/news/bipride-in-darmstadt/) this year for their celebration of Bi Visibility Day in Darmstadt, Germany. This is their first year hanging up the bi flag in celebration of Bi+ pride. Second, in just two days I will be speaking at the [International Bisexual Research Conference](https://www.bisexualresearch.com/conference) about my work on the Bisexual Pride Flag Emoji, followed by a breakout session. These two events culminate the [past year's](https://tannermarino.com/2020/bisexual-pride-flag-emoji-proposal/) worth of my activism and I am so excited to share it with the rest of the world.

Here is my post in celebration of bi visibility day:

Bisexuality to me comes down to being attracted to 1) people of my gender and 2) people that are not my gender. What makes being bi so beautiful is the wide range of potential compatible partners while breaking the gender barrier.

Even with gay rights on the rise throughout the world, there remains intense biphobia within the queer community. This is despite bi people representing half of LGBTQIA+ people. Sadly, this has lead many bi individuals to not feel included in the broader queer community. Bi people frequently question whether they are gay enough; some feel pressure to ‚Äúpick a side‚Äù; those dating the opposite gender fear being assumed to be in a hetero relationship. When it comes to dating, bi people are all too often questioned about their "guy/girl ratio" which reinforces the gender binary the broader community has been trying to break for years. Even on dating sites, promiscuity is assumed, especially with couples looking for a third.

Yet, these challenges are all of our challenges. Now, more than ever, we need to celebrate the fluidity and diversity of sexuality. Just like the community gathered support for transgender people, so can we support our bi friends and family in breaking the stereotypes and pushing forward to build a more inclusive world for all.
