After staying up packing until 5am I 'helped' Dad load up the car and then travelled back to Birmingham. As per, I fell asleep on the way home. Laura finished her last A level exam today, so I congratulated her. Corinne has returned to Oxford for the open day but hasn't been given a room - I'm currently getting a blow-by-blow of how truly shit this makes Hilda's.
