    We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
    
    Article. I.
    
    Section. 1.
    
    All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.
    
    Section. 2.
    
    The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.
    
    No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.
    
    Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.
    
    When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.
    
    The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.
    
    Section. 3.
    
    The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.
    
    Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.
    
    No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.
    
    The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.
    
    The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.
    
    The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
    
    Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.
    
    Section. 4.
    
    The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.
    
    The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.
    
    Section. 5.
    
    Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.
    
    Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.
    
    Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.
    
    Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.
    
    Section. 6.
    
    The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.
    
    No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.
    
    Section. 7.
    
    All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.
    
    Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.
    
    Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.
    
    Section. 8.
    
    The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;

    To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;
    
    To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;
    
    To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;
    
    To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;

    To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;--And
    
    To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.
    
    Section. 9.

    Article. II.
    
    Section. 1.
    
    The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:
    
    Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
    
    The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.
    
    The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
    
    No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.
    
    In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.
    
    The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.
    
    Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."

    He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.
    
    The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.
    
    Section. 3.
    
    He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.
    
    Section. 4.
    
    The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.
    
    Article III.
    
    Section. 1.
    
    The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.
    
    Section. 2.

    In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.
    
    The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.
    
    Section. 3.
    
    Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.
    
    The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.
    
    Article. IV.
    
    Section. 1.
    
    Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.
    
    Section. 2.
    
    The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.
    
    A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.
    
    No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.
    
    Section. 3.
    
    New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.
    
    The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.
    
    Section. 4.
    
    The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened), against domestic Violence.
    
    Article. V.
    
    The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.
    
    Article. VI.
    
    All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.
    
    This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
    
    The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.

    ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND
    
    Lewis Carroll
    
    THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0
    
    CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
    
    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
    bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
    book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
    it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
    conversation?'
    
    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
    hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
    of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
    picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
    close by her.
    
    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
    VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
    Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
    occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
    it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
    OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
    Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
    never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
    to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
    after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
    rabbit-hole under the hedge.
    
    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
    in the world she was to get out again.
    
    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
    dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
    about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
    well.
    
    Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
    plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
    going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
    she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
    looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
    cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
    hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
    she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great
    disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
    of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
    she fell past it.
    
    'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
    think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
    home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
    of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)
    
    Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how
    many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
    somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
    thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
    things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
    was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
    was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
    '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
    or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
    Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
    
    Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
    earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
    their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad
    there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
    right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
    is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and
    she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
    through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an
    ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
    ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
    
    Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
    talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
    (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
    tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
    mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
    like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice
    began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
    sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do
    bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,
    it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
    off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
    Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
    did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
    a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
    
    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
    she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
    long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
    There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
    was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears
    and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she
    turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
    herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
    from the roof.
    
    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
    Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
    door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
    get out again.
    
    Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
    glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
    first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
    but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
    but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
    time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
    behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
    little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
    
    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
    much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
    into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
    that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
    those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
    doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it
    would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
    shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'
    For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
    that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
    impossible.
    
    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
    back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
    any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
    time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here
    before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
    label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large
    letters.
    
    It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was
    not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and
    see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice
    little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
    beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
    the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
    poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
    finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
    forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is
    almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
    
    However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste
    it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
    of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
    buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

      *    *    *    *    *    *    *
    
    'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a
    telescope.'
    
    And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
    brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
    through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
    waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
    she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said
    Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
    what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
    candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
    ever having seen such a thing.
    
    After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
    into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
    door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
    went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
    it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
    best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
    and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
    sat down and cried.
    
    'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,
    rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally
    gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
    and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
    her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
    cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
    for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
    'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!
    Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'
    
    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
    she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
    'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said
    Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
    makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
    get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
    
    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which
    way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
    growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
    size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
    had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
    things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
    in the common way.
    
    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

    CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
    
    'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
    for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm
    opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'
    (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
    sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
    who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure
    _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
    myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
    kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want
    to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
    
    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must
    go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending
    presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
    
         ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
           HEARTHRUG,
             NEAR THE FENDER,
               (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
    
    Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
    
    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
    now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
    key and hurried off to the garden door.
    
    Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
    look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
    hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
    
    'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like
    you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this
    moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
    tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
    deep and reaching half down the hall.
    
    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
    she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
    Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
    one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
    hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
    Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so
    desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
    came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'
    The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
    and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
    
    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
    kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How
    queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
    I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
    same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
    little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
    in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking
    over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
    see if she could have been changed for any of them.
    
    'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long
    ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
    be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
    very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
    it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
    see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
    four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
    However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
    London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
    Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
    Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her
    hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,
    but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the
    same as they used to do:--
    
         'How doth the little crocodile
          Improve his shining tail,
         And pour the waters of the Nile
          On every golden scale!
    
         'How cheerfully he seems to grin,
          How neatly spread his claws,
         And welcome little fishes in
          With gently smiling jaws!'
    
    'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes
    filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and
    I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
    no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
    made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
    use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I
    shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,
    if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here
    till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst
    of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
    of being all alone here!'
    
    As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
    that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
    she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must
    be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure
    herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
    about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
    out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
    it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
    
    'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
    sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and
    now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
    but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
    lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'
    thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!
    And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'
    
    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
    she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
    had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by
    railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
    her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
    to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
    sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
    of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
    made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
    was nine feet high.
    
    'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying
    to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
    being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
    However, everything is queer to-day.'
    
    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
    off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
    it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
    she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
    slipped in like herself.
    
    'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?
    Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
    likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she
    began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
    of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right
    way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
    she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of
    a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather
    inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
    but it said nothing.
    
    'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's
    a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all
    her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
    anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which
    was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
    sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
    'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
    the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
    
    'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would
    YOU like cats if you were me?'
    
    'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry
    about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
    take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
    thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
    pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
    washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
    such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried
    Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
    felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any
    more if you'd rather not.'
    
    'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
    tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
    cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'
    
    'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
    conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not
    answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near
    our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
    know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
    you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
    of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
    you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
    says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
    tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming
    away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
    the pool as it went.
    
    So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
    won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the
    Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
    face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
    trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
    history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
    
    It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
    birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
    a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
    way, and the whole party swam to the shore.


​    
​    
​    
​    CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
​    
    They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
    birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
    to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
    
    The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
    consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
    to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
    known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
    Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
    you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without
    knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
    age, there was no more to be said.
    
    At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
    called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
    dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
    in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
    sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
    
    'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
    is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William
    the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
    to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
    accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
    Mercia and Northumbria--"'
    
    'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
    
    'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did
    you speak?'
    
    'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
    
    'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,
    the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
    the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'
    
    'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
    
    'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
    "it" means.'
    
    'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the
    Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
    archbishop find?'
    
    The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--found
    it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
    crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
    Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning
    to Alice as it spoke.
    
    'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to
    dry me at all.'
    
    'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move
    that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
    remedies--'
    
    'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half
    those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And
    the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
    tittered audibly.
    
    'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that
    the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
    
    'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
    but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
    and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
    
    'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as
    you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
    you how the Dodo managed it.)
    
    First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact
    shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
    along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and
    away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
    liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
    when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
    the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
    round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'
    
    This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
    and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
    (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
    of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
    'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'
    
    'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.
    
    'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
    and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
    way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'
    
    Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
    pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
    not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
    a-piece all round.
    
    'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
    
    'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
    your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
    
    'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
    
    'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
    
    Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
    presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant
    thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
    
    Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
    that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
    to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
    could.
    
    The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
    confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
    theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
    However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
    begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
    
    'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why
    it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
    would be offended again.
    
    'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
    sighing.
    
    'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at
    the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling
    about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
    something like this:--
    
             'Fury said to a
             mouse, That he
            met in the
           house,
         "Let us
          both go to
           law: I will
            prosecute
             YOU.--Come,
               I'll take no
               denial; We
              must have a
            trial: For
          really this
         morning I've
        nothing
        to do."
         Said the
          mouse to the
           cur, "Such
            a trial,
             dear Sir,
                With
              no jury
            or judge,
           would be
          wasting
          our
          breath."
           "I'll be
            judge, I'll
             be jury,"
                Said
             cunning
              old Fury:
              "I'll
              try the
                whole
                cause,
                  and
               condemn
               you
              to
               death."'
    
    'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you
    thinking of?'
    
    'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth
    bend, I think?'
    
    'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
    
    'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
    anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'
    
    'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking
    away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'
    
    'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,
    you know!'
    
    The Mouse only growled in reply.
    
    'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the
    others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook
    its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
    
    'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
    out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
    daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
    YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little
    snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'
    
    'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing
    nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'
    
    'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the
    Lory.
    
    Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
    'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
    can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
    she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'
    
    This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
    birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
    carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air
    doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
    its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
    On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
    
    'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy
    tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
    cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
    any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
    lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard
    a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
    eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
    back to finish his story.    
    
    CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
    
    It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
    anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
    it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
    my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
    ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a
    moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
    and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
    nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
    the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
    had vanished completely.
    
    Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
    called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
    out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
    Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
    in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
    had made.
    
    'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How
    surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
    his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she
    came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
    plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without
    knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
    real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
    fan and gloves.
    
    'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for
    a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she
    began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come
    here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
    nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
    think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
    began ordering people about like that!'
    
    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
    in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
    of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
    and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
    bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
    with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
    to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said
    to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
    this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
    I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
    
    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
    drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
    and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
    down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't
    grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't
    drunk quite so much!'
    
    Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
    and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
    was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
    one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
    Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
    of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I
    can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'
    
    Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
    and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
    seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
    again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
    
    'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't
    always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
    rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and
    yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
    CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
    kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
    There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
    grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful
    tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'
    
    'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am
    now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
    then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'
    
    'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn
    lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all
    for any lesson-books!'
    
    And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
    quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
    a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
    
    'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'
    Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
    the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
    house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
    as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
    
    Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
    the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
    that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll
    go round and get in at the window.'
    
    'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
    she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
    hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
    but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
    from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
    cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
    
    Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And
    then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging
    for apples, yer honour!'
    
    'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and
    help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)
    
    'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
    
    'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')
    
    'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
    window!'
    
    'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'
    
    'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
    
    There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
    now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
    all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her
    hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
    TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of
    cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do
    next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
    sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
    
    She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
    rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
    all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other
    ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
    fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
    together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll
    do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
    rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming
    down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
    fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I
    won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
    go down the chimney!'
    
    'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to
    herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
    Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
    I THINK I can kick a little!'
    
    She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
    till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
    scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
    saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
    see what would happen next.
    
    The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'
    then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then
    silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy
    now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
    us all about it!'
    
    Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought
    Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
    a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
    like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'
    
    'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.
    
    'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called
    out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'
    
    There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I
    wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
    roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
    Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'
    
    'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
    for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
    window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'
    she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'
    which produced another dead silence.
    
    Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
    little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
    head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make
    SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
    make me smaller, I suppose.'
    
    So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
    began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
    the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
    animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
    in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
    something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
    appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
    safe in a thick wood.
    
    'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered
    about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second
    thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
    the best plan.'
    
    It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
    arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
    how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
    the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
    great hurry.
    
    An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
    feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'
    said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
    she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
    hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
    all her coaxing.
    
    Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
    held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
    all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
    and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
    to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
    other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
    over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
    very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
    moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
    the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
    little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
    all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
    its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
    
    This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
    set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
    till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
    
    'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant
    against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
    leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
    only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
    I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
    suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
    question is, what?'
    
    The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
    the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
    looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
    There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
    herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
    behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
    was on the top of it.
    
    She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
    mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
    that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
    hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.


    CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar
    
    The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
    at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
    her in a languid, sleepy voice.
    
    'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
    
    This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
    rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know
    who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
    changed several times since then.'
    
    'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain
    yourself!'
    
    'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not
    myself, you see.'
    
    'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
    
    'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
    'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
    different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
    
    'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
    
    'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you
    have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
    after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
    queer, won't you?'
    
    'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
    
    'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know
    is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
    
    'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'
    
    Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
    Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY
    short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,
    you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'
    
    'Why?' said the Caterpillar.
    
    Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
    good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
    state of mind, she turned away.
    
    'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important
    to say!'
    
    This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
    
    'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
    
    'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
    could.
    
    'No,' said the Caterpillar.
    
    Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
    perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
    minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
    arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think
    you're changed, do you?'
    
    'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
    used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
    
    'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
    
    'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came
    different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
    
    'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.
    
    Alice folded her hands, and began:--
    
       'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
        'And your hair has become very white;
       And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
        Do you think, at your age, it is right?'
    
       'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
        'I feared it might injure the brain;
       But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
        Why, I do it again and again.'
    
       'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
        And have grown most uncommonly fat;
       Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
        Pray, what is the reason of that?'
    
       'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
        'I kept all my limbs very supple
       By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
        Allow me to sell you a couple?'
    
       'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
        For anything tougher than suet;
       Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
        Pray how did you manage to do it?'
    
       'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,
        And argued each case with my wife;
       And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
        Has lasted the rest of my life.'
    
       'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose
        That your eye was as steady as ever;
       Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
        What made you so awfully clever?'
    
       'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
        Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!
       Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
        Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'
    
    'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
    
    'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
    have got altered.'
    
    'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
    there was silence for some minutes.
    
    The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
    
    'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
    
    'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one
    doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
    
    'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
    
    Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
    before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
    
    'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
    
    'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
    said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
    
    'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
    itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
    
    'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
    she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
    offended!'
    
    'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
    hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
    
    This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
    a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
    and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
    mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
    'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
    grow shorter.'
    
    'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.
    
    'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
    aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
    
    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
    to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
    round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
    stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
    of the edge with each hand.
    
    'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
    the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
    blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
    
    She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
    that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
    set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
    so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
    mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
    lefthand bit.
    
      *    *    *    *    *    *    *
    
        *    *    *    *    *    *
    
      *    *    *    *    *    *    *
    
    'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which
    changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
    were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
    an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
    sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
    
    'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my
    shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'
    She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
    except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
    
    As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
    tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
    neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
    just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
    to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
    of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
    her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
    was beating her violently with its wings.
    
    'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
    
    'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
    
    'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
    and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems
    to suit them!'
    
    'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
    
    'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
    hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those
    serpents! There's no pleasing them!'
    
    Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
    saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
    
    'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;
    'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
    haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
    
    'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to
    see its meaning.
    
    'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the
    Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I
    should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
    the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'
    
    'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'
    
    'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to
    invent something!'
    
    'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
    the number of changes she had gone through that day.
    
    'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
    contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE
    with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use
    denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
    egg!'
    
    'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful
    child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
    know.'
    
    'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're
    a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
    
    This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
    minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're
    looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
    whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
    
    'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking
    for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't
    like them raw.'
    
    'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
    down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
    she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
    every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
    remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
    she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
    other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
    succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
    
    It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
    felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
    and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done
    now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
    to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right
    size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that
    to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
    place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives
    there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
    I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the
    righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she
    had brought herself down to nine inches high.


    CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper
    
    For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
    to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
    wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
    otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
    fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
    by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
    frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
    over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
    and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
    
    The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
    nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
    saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
    to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,
    only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An
    invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
    
    Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
    
    Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
    wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
    Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
    door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
    
    Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
    
    'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for
    two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
    are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
    possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
    going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
    a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
    
    'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'
    
    'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on
    without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,
    if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
    He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this
    Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she
    said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
    But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she
    repeated, aloud.
    
    'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'
    
    At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
    skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
    and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
    
    '--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
    as if nothing had happened.
    
    'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
    
    'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first
    question, you know.'
    
    It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really
    dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
    It's enough to drive one crazy!'
    
    The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
    remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for
    days and days.'
    
    'But what am I to do?' said Alice.
    
    'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
    
    'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's
    perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.
    
    The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
    one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
    the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
    a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
    
    'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,
    as well as she could for sneezing.
    
    There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
    sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
    alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
    that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
    the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
    
    'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
    not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why
    your cat grins like that?'
    
    'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'
    
    She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
    jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
    and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--
    
    'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
    that cats COULD grin.'
    
    'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
    
    'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
    pleased to have got into a conversation.
    
    'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'
    
    Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
    be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
    was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
    fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
    the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
    shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
    them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
    that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
    
    'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in
    an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually
    large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
    
    'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
    growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'
    
    'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
    an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
    what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
    twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'
    
    'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
    
    Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
    the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
    be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
    it twelve? I--'
    
    'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
    And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
    lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
    every line:
    
       'Speak roughly to your little boy,
        And beat him when he sneezes:
       He only does it to annoy,
        Because he knows it teases.'
    
             CHORUS.
    
     (In which the cook and the baby joined):--
    
           'Wow! wow! wow!'
    
    While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
    the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
    that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
    
       'I speak severely to my boy,
        I beat him when he sneezes;
       For he can thoroughly enjoy
        The pepper when he pleases!'
    
             CHORUS.
    
           'Wow! wow! wow!'
    
    'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,
    flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play
    croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
    a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
    
    Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
    little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just
    like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
    like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
    straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
    or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
    
    As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
    twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
    ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
    it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'
    thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
    murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the
    little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
    'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing
    yourself.'
    
    The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
    see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
    a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
    eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
    like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'
    she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
    tears.
    
    No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'
    said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
    now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
    to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
    
    Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with
    this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,
    that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
    be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
    felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
    
    So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
    it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said
    to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
    rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other
    children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
    to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she
    was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
    tree a few yards off.
    
    The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
    thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
    felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
    
    'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
    whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
    'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you
    tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'
    
    'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
    
    'I don't much care where--' said Alice.
    
    'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
    
    '--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.
    
    'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
    enough.'
    
    Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
    'What sort of people live about here?'
    
    'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives
    a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March
    Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
    
    'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
    
    'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.
    You're mad.'
    
    'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
    
    'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
    
    Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how
    do you know that you're mad?'
    
    'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'
    
    'I suppose so,' said Alice.
    
    'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
    and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
    wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'
    
    'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.
    
    'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the
    Queen to-day?'
    
    'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited
    yet.'
    
    'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
    
    Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
    things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
    it suddenly appeared again.
    
    'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly
    forgotten to ask.'
    
    'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
    in a natural way.
    
    'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.
    
    Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
    appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
    which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she
    said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
    perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
    it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
    again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
    
    'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.
    
    'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
    vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'
    
    'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
    beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
    remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
    
    'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin
    without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'
    
    She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
    of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
    chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
    was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
    nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
    about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
    saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
    wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'    
    
    CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party
    
    There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
    March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
    between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
    cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very
    uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
    suppose it doesn't mind.'
    
    The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
    one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice
    coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
    down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
    
    'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
    
    Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
    'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
    
    'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
    
    'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.
    
    'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said
    the March Hare.
    
    'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
    many more than three.'
    
    'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
    for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
    
    'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
    severity; 'it's very rude.'
    
    The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
    was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'
    
    'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've
    begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.
    
    'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
    March Hare.
    
    'Exactly so,' said Alice.
    
    'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
    
    'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
    say--that's the same thing, you know.'
    
    'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say
    that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'
    
    'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
    get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
    
    'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
    talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
    as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
    
    'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
    conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
    thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
    which wasn't much.
    
    The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month
    is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
    pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
    and holding it to his ear.
    
    Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'
    
    'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
    the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
    
    'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
    
    'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
    'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
    
    The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
    it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
    nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
    you know.'
    
    Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a
    funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
    tell what o'clock it is!'
    
    'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what
    year it is?'
    
    'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it
    stays the same year for such a long time together.'
    
    'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.
    
    Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
    sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite
    understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.
    
    'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little
    hot tea upon its nose.
    
    The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
    eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'
    
    'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice
    again.
    
    'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'
    
    'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.
    
    'Nor I,' said the March Hare.
    
    Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the
    time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'
    
    'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
    about wasting IT. It's HIM.'
    
    'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
    
    'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
    'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
    
    'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time
    when I learn music.'
    
    'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.
    Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
    you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
    the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
    hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
    time for dinner!'
    
    ('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
    
    'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I
    shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'
    
    'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to
    half-past one as long as you liked.'
    
    'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.
    
    The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We
    quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing
    with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert
    given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
    
         "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
         How I wonder what you're at!"
    
    You know the song, perhaps?'
    
    'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
    
    'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--
    
         "Up above the world you fly,
         Like a tea-tray in the sky.
             Twinkle, twinkle--"'
    
    Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,
    twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch
    it to make it stop.
    
    'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the
    Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his
    head!"'
    
    'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.
    
    'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't
    do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'
    
    A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many
    tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
    
    'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,
    and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
    
    'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
    
    'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'
    
    'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured
    to ask.
    
    'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
    'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'
    
    'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the
    proposal.
    
    'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
    they pinched it on both sides at once.
    
    The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
    hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'
    
    'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.
    
    'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.
    
    'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again
    before it's done.'
    
    'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began
    in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
    they lived at the bottom of a well--'
    
    'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in
    questions of eating and drinking.
    
    'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
    two.
    
    'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd
    have been ill.'
    
    'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'
    
    Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
    living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
    why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
    
    'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
    
    'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't
    take more.'
    
    'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
    MORE than nothing.'
    
    'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
    
    'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.
    
    Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
    to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
    repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
    
    The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
    said, 'It was a treacle-well.'
    
    'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
    Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
    remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
    yourself.'
    
    'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I
    dare say there may be ONE.'
    
    'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
    go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
    you know--'
    
    'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
    
    'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
    
    'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place
    on.'
    
    He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
    moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
    the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
    advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
    before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
    
    Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
    cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
    from?'
    
    'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
    think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'
    
    'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
    notice this last remark.
    
    'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'
    
    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
    some time without interrupting it.
    
    'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
    its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of
    things--everything that begins with an M--'
    
    'Why with an M?' said Alice.
    
    'Why not?' said the March Hare.
    
    Alice was silent.
    
    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
    a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with
    a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as
    mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
    things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a
    drawing of a muchness?'
    
    'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't
    think--'
    
    'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
    
    This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
    great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
    neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
    looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
    the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
    the teapot.
    
    'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her
    way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
    my life!'
    
    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
    leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But
    everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in
    she went.
    
    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
    glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,
    and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
    led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
    had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
    then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at
    last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
    fountains.
    
    CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground
    
    A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
    growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
    painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went
    nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of
    them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like
    that!'
    
    'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my
    elbow.'
    
    On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the
    blame on others!'
    
    'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only
    yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'
    
    'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
    
    'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.
    
    'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for
    bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'
    
    Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust
    things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
    them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
    all of them bowed low.
    
    'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting
    those roses?'
    
    Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
    voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
    RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
    was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
    So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this
    moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
    out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw
    themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
    and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
    
    First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
    the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
    corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
    diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
    the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
    jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
    with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
    them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
    nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
    noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's
    crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
    procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
    
    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
    like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
    of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of
    a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their
    faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,
    and waited.
    
    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
    at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the
    Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
    
    'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
    Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'
    
    'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;
    but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
    all. I needn't be afraid of them!'
    
    'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who
    were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their
    faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the
    pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
    courtiers, or three of her own children.
    
    'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no
    business of MINE.'
    
    The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
    moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'
    
    'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
    silent.
    
    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my
    dear: she is only a child!'
    
    The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them
    over!'
    
    The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
    
    'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
    gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
    the royal children, and everybody else.
    
    'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,
    turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'
    
    'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going
    down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'
    
    'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
    'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the
    soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
    to Alice for protection.
    
    'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large
    flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
    minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
    others.
    
    'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.
    
    'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted
    in reply.
    
    'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'
    
    The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
    evidently meant for her.
    
    'Yes!' shouted Alice.
    
    'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
    wondering very much what would happen next.
    
    'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was
    walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
    
    'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'
    
    'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
    anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
    tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under
    sentence of execution.'
    
    'What for?' said Alice.
    
    'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.
    
    'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
    "What for?"'
    
    'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
    scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
    tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
    Queen said--'
    
    'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
    people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
    other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
    began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
    her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
    the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
    up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
    
    The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
    she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
    her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
    its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
    blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
    with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
    laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
    again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
    itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
    generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
    hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
    and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
    conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
    
    The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
    all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
    time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
    shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a
    minute.
    
    Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
    dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
    'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully
    fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one
    left alive!'
    
    She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
    could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
    in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
    a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
    'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'
    
    'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
    enough for it to speak with.
    
    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use
    speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one
    of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
    down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
    she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
    enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
    
    'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a
    complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
    oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;
    at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how
    confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
    arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
    ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
    it ran away when it saw mine coming!'
    
    'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.
    
    'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed
    that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
    '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'
    
    The Queen smiled and passed on.
    
    'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking
    at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
    
    'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to
    introduce it.'
    
    'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may
    kiss my hand if it likes.'
    
    'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
    
    'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'
    He got behind Alice as he spoke.
    
    'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,
    but I don't remember where.'
    
    'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called
    the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would
    have this cat removed!'
    
    The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
    'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
    
    'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he
    hurried off.
    
    Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
    on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
    passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
    executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
    of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
    whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
    
    The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
    to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
    other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
    other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
    sort of way to fly up into a tree.
    
    By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
    was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't
    matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side
    of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
    escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
    friend.
    
    When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
    large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
    the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
    while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
    
    The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
    the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
    all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
    what they said.
    
    The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
    there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
    thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.
    
    The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
    beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
    
    The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
    than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
    remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
    
    Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:
    you'd better ask HER about it.'
    
    'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'
    And the executioner went off like an arrow.
    
     The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
    by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
    disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
    looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
    
    CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story
    
    'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'
    said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and
    they walked off together.
    
    Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
    to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
    savage when they met in the kitchen.
    
    'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
    though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
    well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'
    she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
    rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
    them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
    sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so
    stingy about it, you know--'
    
    She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
    startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking
    about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
    tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
    a bit.'
    
    'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
    
    'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only
    you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
    she spoke.
    
    Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
    Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
    right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
    uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
    bore it as well as she could.
    
    'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up
    the conversation a little.
    
    ''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love,
    'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'
    
    'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding
    their own business!'
    
    'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her
    sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral
    of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
    themselves."'
    
    'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.
    
    'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'
    the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
    the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'
    
    'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
    have the experiment tried.
    
    'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
    the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'
    
    'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
    
    'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of
    putting things!'
    
    'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.
    
    'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
    everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
    the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of
    yours."'
    
    'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,
    'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'
    
    'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that
    is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more
    simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
    appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
    than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'
    
    'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if
    I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'
    
    'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in
    a pleased tone.
    
    'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said
    Alice.
    
    'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present
    of everything I've said as yet.'
    
    'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give
    birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out
    loud.
    
    'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
    little chin.
    
    'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
    feel a little worried.
    
    'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and
    the m--'
    
    But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
    in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked
    into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
    in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
    
    'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
    
    'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the
    ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in
    about half no time! Take your choice!'
    
    The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
    
    'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was
    too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
    croquet-ground.
    
    The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
    resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
    back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
    cost them their lives.
    
    All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
    the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her
    head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
    who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
    the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
    players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
    under sentence of execution.
    
    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have
    you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'
    
    'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
    
    'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.
    
    'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.
    
    'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'
    
    As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
    to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good
    thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
    number of executions the Queen had ordered.
    
    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
    (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy
    thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock
    Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
    executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with
    the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
    the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
    after that savage Queen: so she waited.
    
    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
    she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,
    half to itself, half to Alice.
    
    'What IS the fun?' said Alice.
    
    'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never
    executes nobody, you know. Come on!'
    
    'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly
    after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'
    
    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
    sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
    nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
    pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the
    Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his
    fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'
    
    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
    full of tears, but said nothing.
    
    'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your
    history, she do.'
    
    'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit
    down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
    
    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
    herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But
    she waited patiently.
    
    'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real
    Turtle.'
    
    These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
    occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant
    heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
    saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could
    not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
    nothing.
    
    'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
    though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the
    sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'
    
    'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.
    
    'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle
    angrily: 'really you are very dull!'
    
    'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'
    added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
    Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
    to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
    and he went on in these words:
    
    'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'
    
    'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
    
    'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
    
    'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
    The Mock Turtle went on.
    
    'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'
    
    'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
    as all that.'
    
    'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
    
    'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'
    
    'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
    
    'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
    
    'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in
    a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
    "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'
    
    'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
    the sea.'
    
    'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I
    only took the regular course.'
    
    'What was that?' inquired Alice.
    
    'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle
    replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
    Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'
    
    'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'
    
    The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of
    uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'
    
    'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
    
    'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
    you ARE a simpleton.'
    
    Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
    turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'
    
    'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
    the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
    Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
    that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
    Fainting in Coils.'
    
    'What was THAT like?' said Alice.
    
    'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too
    stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'
    
    'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.
    He was an old crab, HE was.'
    
    'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught
    Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'
    
    'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
    creatures hid their faces in their paws.
    
    'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to
    change the subject.
    
    'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so
    on.'
    
    'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
    
    'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
    'because they lessen from day to day.'
    
    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
    before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a
    holiday?'
    
    'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
    
    'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
    
    'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
    tone: 'tell her something about the games now.'

​    
​    
​    CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille
​    
    The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
    his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
    two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'
    said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
    the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
    running down his cheeks, he went on again:--
    
    'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said
    Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
    (Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and
    said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
    Lobster Quadrille is!'
    
    'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'
    
    'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the
    sea-shore--'
    
    'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
    then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'
    
    'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.
    
    '--you advance twice--'
    
    'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.
    
    'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'
    
    '--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.
    
    'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'
    
    'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
    
    '--as far out to sea as you can--'
    
    'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
    
    'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
    about.
    
    'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
    
    'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock
    Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
    jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
    and quietly, and looked at Alice.
    
    'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.
    
    'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.
    
    'Very much indeed,' said Alice.
    
    'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
    'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'
    
    'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'
    
    So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
    then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
    forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
    and sadly:--
    
     '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
     "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
    
     See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
     They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?
    
     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
    
     "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
     When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
     But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
     Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
    
     Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
     Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
    
     '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
     "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
     The further off from England the nearer is to France--
     Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
    
     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'
    
    'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling
    very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song
    about the whiting!'
    
    'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,
    of course?'
    
    'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself
    hastily.
    
    'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've
    seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'
    
    'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in
    their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'
    
    'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all
    wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
    reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her
    about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.
    
    'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters
    to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
    way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
    them out again. That's all.'
    
    'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much
    about a whiting before.'
    
    'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you
    know why it's called a whiting?'
    
    'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'
    
    'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
    
    Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated
    in a wondering tone.
    
    'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what
    makes them so shiny?'
    
    Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
    answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'
    
    'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
    'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'
    
    'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
    
    'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
    'any shrimp could have told you that.'
    
    'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
    on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we
    don't want YOU with us!"'
    
    'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no
    wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'
    
    'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
    
    'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and
    told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'
    
    'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.
    
    'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
    the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'
    
    'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said
    Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,
    because I was a different person then.'
    
    'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
    
    'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
    'explanations take such a dreadful time.'
    
    So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
    saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
    the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
    their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
    on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
    her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the
    words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
    and said 'That's very curious.'
    
    'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
    
    'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I
    should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
    begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
    authority over Alice.
    
    'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
    Gryphon.
    
    'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'
    thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she
    got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
    Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
    very queer indeed:--
    
      ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
      "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
      As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
      Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'
    
           [later editions continued as follows
      When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
      And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
      But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
      His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
    
    'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the
    Gryphon.
    
    'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds
    uncommon nonsense.'
    
    Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
    wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.
    
    'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.
    
    'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next
    verse.'
    
    'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them
    out with his nose, you know?'
    
    'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully
    puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
    
    'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it
    begins "I passed by his garden."'
    
    Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
    wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
    
      'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
      How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'
    
        [later editions continued as follows
      The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
      While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
      When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
      Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
      While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
      And concluded the banquet--]
    
    'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
    interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
    confusing thing I ever heard!'
    
    'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
    only too glad to do so.
    
    'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went
    on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'
    
    'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice
    replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
    'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old
    fellow?'
    
    The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
    with sobs, to sing this:--
    
       'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
       Waiting in a hot tureen!
       Who for such dainties would not stoop?
       Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
       Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
       Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
         Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
    
       'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
       Game, or any other dish?
       Who would not give all else for two
       Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
       Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
       Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
         Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'
    
    'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
    to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the
    distance.
    
    'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
    off, without waiting for the end of the song.
    
    'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
    answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
    came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--
    
       'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
         Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'
    
    CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?
    
    The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
    arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
    birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
    standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
    him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
    and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
    was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
    that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the
    trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there
    seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
    her, to pass away the time.
    
    Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
    about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
    the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to
    herself, 'because of his great wig.'
    
    The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
    wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
    not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
    
    'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'
    (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were
    animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said
    this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
    it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
    age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done
    just as well.
    
    The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they
    doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put
    down yet, before the trial's begun.'
    
    'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for
    fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
    
    'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
    hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the
    King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
    was talking.
    
    Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
    that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,
    and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
    'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice
    muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.
    
    One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
    could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
    very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
    that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
    at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
    obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
    of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
    
    'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
    
    On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
    unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
    
       'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
          All on a summer day:
        The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
          And took them quite away!'
    
    'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
    
    'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great
    deal to come before that!'
    
    'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
    blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'
    
    The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
    hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your
    Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
    my tea when I was sent for.'
    
    'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'
    
    The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
    court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it
    was,' he said.
    
    'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
    
    'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
    
    'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
    wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
    reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
    
    'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
    
    'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
    
    'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
    memorandum of the fact.
    
    'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
    my own. I'm a hatter.'
    
    Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
    who turned pale and fidgeted.
    
    'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
    you executed on the spot.'
    
    This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
    from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
    his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
    bread-and-butter.
    
    Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
    her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
    grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
    the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
    long as there was room for her.
    
    'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
    next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'
    
    'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'
    
    'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.
    
    'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
    too.'
    
    'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that
    ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
    other side of the court.
    
    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
    just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
    of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
    which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
    
    'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you
    executed, whether you're nervous or not.'
    
    'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
    '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
    bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'
    
    'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
    
    'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
    
    'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you
    take me for a dunce? Go on!'
    
    'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
    that--only the March Hare said--'
    
    'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
    
    'You did!' said the Hatter.
    
    'I deny it!' said the March Hare.
    
    'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'
    
    'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
    anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
    nothing, being fast asleep.
    
    'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'
    
    'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
    
    'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
    
    'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'
    
    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
    down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.
    
    'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.
    
    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
    the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
    explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
    up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
    head first, and then sat upon it.)
    
    'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read
    in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts
    at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
    court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'
    
    'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the
    King.
    
    'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'
    
    'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
    
    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
    
    'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get
    on better.'
    
    'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
    Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
    
    'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
    without even waiting to put his shoes on.
    
    '--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the
    officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
    to the door.
    
    'Call the next witness!' said the King.
    
    The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
    her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
    court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
    
    'Give your evidence,' said the King.
    
    'Shan't,' said the cook.
    
    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
    'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'
    
    'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
    after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
    nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'
    
    'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
    
    'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
    
    'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
    Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
    whiskers!'
    
    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
    turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
    disappeared.
    
    'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next
    witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,
    YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
    ache!'
    
    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
    curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't
    got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when
    the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
    name 'Alice!'
    
    CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence
    
    'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
    large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
    a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
    upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
    they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
    she had accidentally upset the week before.
    
    'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
    began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
    the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
    that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
    they would die.
    
    'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until
    all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with
    great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
    
    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
    the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
    tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
    it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said
    to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
    one way up as the other.'
    
    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
    upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
    them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
    accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
    anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
    court.
    
    'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.
    
    'Nothing,' said Alice.
    
    'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
    
    'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
    
    'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were
    just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
    interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a
    very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
    
    'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on
    to himself in an undertone,
    
    'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying
    which word sounded best.
    
    Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
    Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
    'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
    
    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
    his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule
    Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
    
    Everybody looked at Alice.
    
    'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
    
    'You are,' said the King.
    
    'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
    
    'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a
    regular rule: you invented it just now.'
    
    'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
    
    'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
    
    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your
    verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
    
    'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White
    Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked
    up.'
    
    'What's in it?' said the Queen.
    
    'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a
    letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
    
    'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to
    nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
    
    'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
    
    'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's
    nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
    added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
    
    'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.
    
    'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
    about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
    
    'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury
    all brightened up again.)
    
    'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they
    can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'
    
    'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter
    worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
    name like an honest man.'
    
    There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
    clever thing the King had said that day.
    
    'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
    
    'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know
    what they're about!'
    
    'Read them,' said the King.
    
    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please
    your Majesty?' he asked.
    
    'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you
    come to the end: then stop.'
    
    These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
    
       'They told me you had been to her,
        And mentioned me to him:
       She gave me a good character,
        But said I could not swim.
    
       He sent them word I had not gone
        (We know it to be true):
       If she should push the matter on,
        What would become of you?
    
       I gave her one, they gave him two,
        You gave us three or more;
       They all returned from him to you,
        Though they were mine before.
    
       If I or she should chance to be
        Involved in this affair,
       He trusts to you to set them free,
        Exactly as we were.
    
       My notion was that you had been
        (Before she had this fit)
       An obstacle that came between
        Him, and ourselves, and it.
    
       Don't let him know she liked them best,
        For this must ever be
       A secret, kept from all the rest,
        Between yourself and me.'
    
    'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the
    King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'
    
    'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
    in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
    him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of
    meaning in it.'
    
    The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an
    atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
    
    'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of
    trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'
    he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
    with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID
    I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the
    Knave.
    
    The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he
    certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)
    
    'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over
    the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of
    course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he
    did with the tarts, you know--'
    
    'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.
    
    'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
    on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE
    HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the
    Queen.
    
    'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
    as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
    slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
    began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
    it lasted.)
    
    'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court
    with a smile. There was a dead silence.
    
    'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
    'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the
    twentieth time that day.
    
    'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
    
    'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the
    sentence first!'
    
    'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
    
    'I won't!' said Alice.
    
    'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
    moved.
    
    'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this
    time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
    
    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
    her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
    tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
    head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
    leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
    
    'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've
    had!'
    
    'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her
    sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
    of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
    finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,
    dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So
    Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
    what a wonderful dream it had been.
    
    But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
    hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
    wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
    this was her dream:--
    
    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
    hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
    up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
    queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
    WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
    listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
    of her little sister's dream.
    
    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
    frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
    could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
    shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
    ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
    was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
    around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
    Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
    filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
    Turtle.
    
    So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
    Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
    would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
    wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
    teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill
    cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
    shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
    knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
    of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
    heavy sobs.
    
    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
    would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
    keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
    childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
    make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
    with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
    all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
    remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

                   A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
    
                   A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
                   War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
                   into infinity.
    
                        It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                        striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                        victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
    
                        During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                        secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                        Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                        power to destroy an entire planet.
    
                        Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                        Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                        the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                        restore freedom to the galaxy...
    
                   The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
                   eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
                   silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
                   from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
                   by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
                   laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
                   the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY
    
                   An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
                   D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
                   through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
                   old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
                   face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
                   Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
                   human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
                   surface of an Art Deco design.
    
                   Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Did you hear that? They've shut down 
                             the main reactor. We'll be destroyed 
                             for sure. This is madness!
    
                   Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in 
                   the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             We're doomed!
    
                   The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that 
                   only another robot could understand.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             There'll be no escape for the Princess 
                             this time.
    
                   Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as 
                   loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment 
                   are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             What's that?
    
                   EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
    
                   The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade 
                   Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the 
                   underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
    
                   The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a 
                   tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and 
                   a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make 
                   their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
    
                   In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with 
                   laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns 
                   creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck 
                   behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers 
                   who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered 
                   arms and faces.
    
                   An explosion hits near the robots.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I should have known better than to 
                             trust the logic of a half-sized 
                             thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
    
                   Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages 
                   around the two hapless robots.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY
    
                   A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. 
                   The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone 
                   figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations 
                   who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy 
                   hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable 
                   lad with a prize-winning smile.
    
                   A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a 
                   large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the 
                   desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided 
                   by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot 
                   appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  
                   A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and 
                   he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his 
                   utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying 
                   the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired 
                   Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet 
                   above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the 
                   tiny robot to follow him.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Hurry up! Come with me! What are you 
                             waiting for?! Get in gear!
    
                   The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and 
                   smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his 
                   arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps 
                   into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum 
                   madly.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY
    
                   The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his 
                   way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is 
                   Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured 
                   by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which 
                   stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the 
                   Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away 
                   from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through 
                   the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run 
                   in a frenzied panic.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
    
                   A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  
                   Artoo makes beeping sounds.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
    
                   Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is 
                   nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel 
                   soldiers can be heard in the distance.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
    
                   A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and 
                   he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
                   filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years 
                   old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, 
                   dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting 
                   something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little 
                   robot joins his companion.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             At last! Where have you been?
    
                   Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             They're heading in this direction. 
                             What are we going to do? We'll be 
                             sent to the spice mine of Kessel or 
                             smashed into who knows what!
    
                   Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the 
                   subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Wait a minute, where are you going?
    
                   Artoo responds with electronic beeps.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR
    
                   The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies 
                   of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as 
                   an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
    
                                         IMPERIAL OFFICER
                             The Death Star plans are not in the 
                             main computer.
    
                   Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles 
                   in vain.
    
                                         VADER
                             Where are those transmissions you 
                             intercepted?
    
                   Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
    
                                         VADER
                             What have you done with those plans?
    
                                         REBEL OFFICER
                             We intercepted no transmissions. 
                             Aaah... This is a consular ship. 
                             Were on a diplomatic mission.
    
                                         VADER
                             If this is a consular ship... were 
                             is the Ambassador?
    
                   The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the 
                   Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a 
                   gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. 
                   Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to 
                   his troops.
    
                                         VADER
                             Commander, tear this ship apart until 
                             you've found those plans and bring 
                             me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
    
                   The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY
    
                   The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the 
                   stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia 
                   Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her 
                   eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds 
                   of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the 
                   troopers spots her.
    
                                         TROOPER
                             There she is! Set for stun!
    
                   Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with 
                   her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a 
                   paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.
    
                                         TROOPER
                             She'll be all right. Inform Lord 
                             Vader we have a prisoner.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY
    
                   Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. 
                   He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light 
                   begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into 
                   the cramped four-man pod.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Hey, you're not permitted in there. 
                             It's restricted. You'll be deactivated 
                             for sure..
    
                   Artoo beeps something to him.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Don't call me a mindless philosopher, 
                             you overweight glob of grease! Now 
                             come out before somebody sees you.
    
                   Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding 
                   the mission he is about to perform.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Secret mission? What plans? What are 
                             you talking about? I'm not getting 
                             in there!
    
                   Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps 
                   and twangs angrily.
    
                   A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris 
                   through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, 
                   after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky 
                   robot jumps into the lifepod.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I'm going to regret this.
    
                   INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER
    
                   On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified 
                   robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
    
                                         CHIEF PILOT
                             There goes another one.
    
                                         CAPTAIN
                             Hold your fire. There are no life 
                             forms. It must have been short-
                             circuited.
    
                   INT. LIFEPOD
    
                   Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  
                   Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             That's funny, the damage doesn't 
                             look as bad from out here.
    
                   Artoo beeps an assuring response.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Are you sure this things safe?
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
    
                   Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white 
                   buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty 
                   empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to 
                   get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist 
                   at Luke as he flies past.
    
                                         WOMAN
                             I've told you kids to slow down!
    
                   INT. POWER STATION - DAY
    
                   Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged 
                   mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been 
                   asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the 
                   office, yelling wildly.
    
                                         FIXER
                             Did I hear a young noise blast through 
                             here?
    
                                         CAMIE
                             It was just wormie on another rampage.
    
                   Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak 
                   and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are 
                   playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, 
                   handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy 
                   city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics 
                   of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the 
                   background.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
    
                   Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great 
                   joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I didn't know you were back! When 
                             did you get in?
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Just now. I wanted to surprise you, 
                             hot shot. I thought you'd be here... 
                             certainly didn't expect you to be 
                             out working.
                                  (he laughs)
    
                                         LUKE
                             The Academy didn't change you 
                             much...but you're back so soon? Hey, 
                             what happened, didn't you get your 
                             commission?
    
                   Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Of course I got it. Signed aboard 
                             The Rand Ecliptic last week. First 
                             mate Biggs Darklighter at your 
                             service...
                                  (he salutes)
                             ...I just came to say good-bye to 
                             all you unfortunate landlocked 
                             simpletons.
    
                   Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend 
                   is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of 
                   it.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I almost forgot. There's a battle 
                             going on! Right here in our system. 
                             Come and look!
    
                                         DEAK
                             Not again! Forget it.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - 
                   DAY
    
                   The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie 
                   and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. 
                   Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
    
                                         LUKE
                             There they are!
    
                   Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to 
                   see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars 
                   Biggs sees two small silver specks.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             That's no battle, hot shot... they're 
                             just sitting there! Probably a 
                             freighter-tanker refueling.
    
                                         LUKE
                             But there was a lot of firing 
                             earlier...
    
                   Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the 
                   building in the process. Luke grabs them.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Hey, easy with those...
    
                                         CAMIE
                             Don't worry about it, Wormie.
    
                   The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs 
                   his shoulders in resignation.
    
                                         FIXER
                             I keep telling you, the Rebellion is 
                             a long way from here. I doubt if the 
                             Empire would even fight to keep this 
                             system. Believe me Luke, this planet 
                             is a big hunk of nothing...
    
                   Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The 
                   group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about 
                   Luke's ineptitude.
    
                   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY
    
                   Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad 
                   of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is 
                   brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly 
                   marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader 
                   emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard 
                   at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Lord Vader, I should have known. 
                             Only you could be so bold. The 
                             Imperial Senate will not sit for 
                             this, when they hear you've attacked 
                             a diplomatic...
    
                                         VADER
                             Don't play games with me, Your 
                             Highness. You weren't on any mercy 
                             mission this time. You passed directly 
                             through a restricted system. Several 
                             transmissions were beamed to this 
                             ship by Rebel spies. I want to know 
                             what happened to the plans they sent 
                             you.
    
                                         LEIA
                             I don't know what you're talking 
                             about. I'm a member of the Imperial 
                             Senate on a diplomatic mission to 
                             Alderaan...
    
                                         VADER
                             You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... 
                             and a traitor. Take her away!
    
                   Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering 
                   hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander 
                   turns to Vader.
    
                                         COMMANDER
                             Holding her is dangerous. If word of 
                             this gets out, it could generate 
                             sympathy for the Rebellion in the 
                             senate.
    
                                         VADER
                             I have traced the Rebel spies to 
                             her. Now she is my only link to find 
                             their secret base!
    
                                         COMMANDER
                             She'll die before she tells you 
                             anything.
    
                                         VADER
                             Leave that to me. Send a distress 
                             signal and then inform the senate 
                             that all aboard were killed!
    
                   Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. 
                   They stop and snap to attention.
    
                                         SECOND OFFICER
                             Lord Vader, the battle station plans 
                             are not aboard this ship! And no 
                             transmissions were made. An escape 
                             pod was jettisoned during the 
                             fighting, but no life forms were 
                             aboard.
    
                   Vader turns to the Commander.
    
                                         VADER
                             She must have hidden the plans in 
                             the escape pod. Send a detachment 
                             down to retrieve them. See to it 
                             personally, Commander. There'll be 
                             no one to stop us this time.
    
                                         COMMANDER
                             Yes, sir.
    
                   EXT. SPACE
    
                   The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the 
                   planet Tatooine.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT
    
                   Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas 
                   meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids 
                   kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily 
                   work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in 
                   the distance rests half buried in the sand.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             How did I get into this mess? I really 
                             don't know how. We seem to be made 
                             to suffer. It's our lot in life.
    
                   Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I've got to rest before I fall apart. 
                             My joints are almost frozen.
    
                   Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             What a desolate place this is.
    
                   Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts 
                   off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio 
                   stops and yells at him.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Where are you going?
    
                   A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small 
                   robot.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Well, I'm not going that way. It's 
                             much too rocky. This way is much 
                             easier.
    
                   Artoo counters with a long whistle.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             What makes you think there are 
                             settlements over there?
    
                   Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Don't get technical with me.
    
                   Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             What mission? What are you talking 
                             about? I've had just about enough of 
                             you! Go that way! You'll be 
                             malfunctioning within a day, you 
                             nearsighted scrap pile!
    
                   Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the 
                   direction of the vast dune sea.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             And don't let me catch you following 
                             me begging for help, because you 
                             won't get it.
    
                   Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges 
                   off in the direction of the towering mesas.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             No more adventures. I'm not going 
                             that way.
    
                   Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant 
                   mountains.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA
    
                   Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a 
                   dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless 
                   miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant 
                   rock mesas.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             That malfunctioning little twerp. 
                             This is all his fault! He tricked me 
                             into going this way, but he'll do no 
                             better.
    
                   In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand 
                   from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of 
                   reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving 
                   towards him.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm 
                             saved!
    
                   The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the 
                   approaching transport.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Over here! Help! Please, help!
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
    
                   Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer 
                   and the others can be heard working inside.
    
                                         LUKE
                                  (Very animated)
                             ...so I cut off my power, shut down 
                             the afterburners and came in low on 
                             Deak's trail. I was so close I thought 
                             I was going to fry my instruments. 
                             As it was I busted up the Skyhopper 
                             pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty 
                             upset. He grounded me for the rest 
                             of the season. You should have been 
                             there... it was fantastic.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             You ought to take it easy Luke. You 
                             may be the hottest bushpilot this 
                             side of Mos Eisley, but those little 
                             Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it 
                             up, and one day, whammo, you're going 
                             to be nothing more than a dark spot 
                             on the down side of a canyon wall.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Look who's talking. Now that you've 
                             been around those giant starships 
                             you're beginning to sound like my 
                             uncle. You've gotten soft in the 
                             city...
    
                                         BIGGS
                             I've missed you kid.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, things haven't been the same 
                             since you left, Biggs. It's been 
                             so... quiet.
    
                   Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Luke, I didn't come back just to say 
                             good-bye... I shouldn't tell you 
                             this, but you're the only one I can 
                             trust... and if I don't come back, I 
                             want somebody to know.
    
                   Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What are you talking about?
    
                                         BIGGS
                             I made some friends at the Academy.
                                  (he whispers)
                             ...when our frigate goes to one of 
                             the central systems, we're going to 
                             jump ship and join the Alliance...
    
                   Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! 
                             How?
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth 
                             bigger than a meteor crater!
    
                                         LUKE
                             I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
                                  (he whispers)
                             Listen how quiet I am. You can barely 
                             hear me...
    
                   Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             My friend has a friend on Bestine 
                             who might help us make contact.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You're crazy! You could wander around 
                             forever trying to find them.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             I know it's a long shot, but if I 
                             don't find them I'll do what I can 
                             on my own... It's what we always 
                             talked about. Luke, I'm not going to 
                             wait for the Empire to draft me into 
                             service. The Rebellion is spreading 
                             and I want to be on the right side -- 
                             the side I believe in.
    
                                         LUKE
                             And I'm stuck here...
    
                                         BIGGS
                             I thought you were going to the 
                             Academy next term. You'll get your 
                             chance to get off this rock.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Not likely! I had to cancel my 
                             application. There has been a lot of 
                             unrest among the Sandpeople since 
                             you left... they've even raided the 
                             outskirts of Anchorhead.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Your uncle could hold off a whole 
                             colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I know, but he's got enough vaporators 
                             going to make the place pay off. He 
                             needs me for just one more season. I 
                             can't leave him now.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             I feel for you, Luke, you're going 
                             to have to learn what seems to be 
                             important or what really is important. 
                             What good is all your uncle's work 
                             if it's taken over by the Empire?... 
                             You know they're starting to 
                             nationalize commerce in the central 
                             systems... it won't be long before 
                             your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving 
                             for the greater glory of the Empire.
    
                                         LUKE
                             It couldn't happen here. You said it 
                             yourself. The Empire won't bother 
                             with this rock.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Things always change.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I wish I was going... Are you going 
                             to be around long?
    
                                         BIGGS
                             No, I'm leaving in the morning...
    
                                         LUKE
                             Then I guess I won't see you.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, I'll be at the Academy next 
                             season... after that who knows. I 
                             won't be drafted into the Imperial 
                             Starfleet that's for sure... Take 
                             care of yourself, you'll always be 
                             the best friend I've got.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             So long, Luke.
    
                   Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the 
                   power station.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET
    
                   The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange 
                   foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures 
                   fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock 
                   canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he 
                   goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for 
                   a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
    
                   In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
                   and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little 
                   further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a 
                   pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the 
                   narrow path.
    
                   The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until 
                   suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out 
                   of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages 
                   one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his 
                   back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then 
                   off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller 
                   than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they 
                   cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and 
                   their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be 
                   seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave 
                   the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down 
                   the trail.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
    
                   The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
                   like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a 
                   small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a 
                   large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot 
                   is sucked into the giant machine.
    
                   The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders 
                   and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
    
                   INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA
    
                   It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo 
                   switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles 
                   around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty 
                   metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and 
                   maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper 
                   and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end 
                   of the chamber.
    
                   INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA
    
                   Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the 
                   middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various 
                   shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, 
                   while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls 
                   out from the gloom.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
    
                   A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
    
                   The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent 
                   twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain 
                   ridge.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY
    
                   Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
                   buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. 
                   A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.
    
                                         FIRST TROOPER
                             Someone was in the pod. The tracks 
                             go off in this direction.
    
                   A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand 
                   and gives it to the first trooper.
    
                                         SECOND TROOPER
                             Look, sir -- droids.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES
    
                   The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.
    
                   INT. SANDCRAWLER
    
                   Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped 
                   prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Wake up! Wake up!
    
                   Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, 
                   creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  
                   Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights 
                   pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long 
                   chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding 
                   white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the 
                   odd assortment of robots.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             We're doomed.
    
                   A Jawa starts moving toward them.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Do you think they'll melt us down?
    
                   Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this 
                             never end?
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON
    
                   The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their 
                   battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of 
                   the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small 
                   homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground 
                   surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small 
                   adobe block house.
    
                   The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening 
                   them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. 
                   The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting 
                   small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils 
                   should be.
    
                   Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, 
                   a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are 
                   sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully 
                   inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- 
                   shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little 
                   Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales 
                   pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
    
                   A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the 
                   homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru 
                   standing in the main courtyard.
    
                                         BERU
                             Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a 
                             translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
    
                                         LUKE
                             It looks like we don't have much of 
                             a choice but I'll remind him.
    
                   Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment 
                   for sale with the Jawa leader.
    
                                         OWEN
                             I have no need for a protocol droid.

                             this -- that's why I've also been 
                             programmed for over thirty secondary 
                             functions that...

                             What I really need is a droid that 
                             understands the binary language of 
                             moisture vaporators.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was 
                             programming binary load lifter... 
                             very similar to your vaporators. You 
                             could say...
    
                                         OWEN
                             Do you speak Bocce?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Of course I can, sir. It's like a 
                             second language for me... I'm as 
                             fluent in Bocce...
    
                                         OWEN
                             All right shut up!
                                  (turning to Jawa)
                             I'll take this one.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Shutting up, sir.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Luke, take these two over to the 
                             garage, will you? I want you to have 
                             both of them cleaned up before dinner.
    
                                         LUKE
                             But I was going into Toshi Station 
                             to pick up some power converters...
    
                                         OWEN
                             You can waste time with your friends 
                             when your chores are done. Now come 
                             on, get to it!
    
                                         LUKE
                             All right, come on! And the red one, 
                             come on. Well, come on, Red, let's 
                             go.
    
                   As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back 
                   into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep 
                   and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained 
                   by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
    
                   Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two 
                   robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the 
                   head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

                             Yeah?

                             This R2 unit has a bad motivator. 
                             Look!
    
                                         OWEN
                                  (to the head Jawa)
                             Hey, what're you trying to push on 
                             us?
    
                   The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked 
                   out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract 
                   attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps 
                   Luke on the shoulder.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                                  (pointing to Artoo)
                             Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is 
                             in prime condition. A real bargain.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Uncle Owen...

                             Yeah?

                                  (to Jawa)
                             What about that blue one? We'll take 
                             that one.
    
                   With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged 
                   astro-droid for Artoo.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Yeah, take it away.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very 
                             pleased with that one, sir. He really 
                             is in first-class condition. I've 
                             worked with him before. Here he comes.
    
                   Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots 
                   trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Okay, let's go.

                             Now, don't you forget this! Why I 
                             should stick my neck out for you is 
                             quite beyond my capacity!
    
                   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
    
                   The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful 
                   atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers 
                   himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the 
                   battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery 
                   with a cord to his face.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Thank the maker! This oil bath is 
                             going to feel so good. I've got such 
                             a bad case of dust contamination, I 
                             can barely move!
    
                   Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought 
                   as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man 
                   Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. 
                   Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he 
                   slams a wrench across the workbench.

                             It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is 
                             right. I'm never gonna get out of 
                             here!
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Is there anything I might do to help?
    
                   Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains 
                   and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, not unless you can alter time, 
                             speed up the harvest, or teleport me 
                             off this rock!
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I don't think so, sir. I'm only a 
                             droid and not very knowledgeable 
                             about such things. Not on this planet, 
                             anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm 
                             not even sure which planet I'm on.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, if there's a bright center to 
                             the universe, you're on the planet 
                             that it's farthest from.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I see, sir.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Uh, you can call me Luke.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I see, sir Luke.
    
                                         LUKE
                                  (laughing)
                             Just Luke.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg 
                             relations, and this is my counterpart, 
                             Artoo-Detoo.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Hello.
    
                   Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to 
                   scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome 
                   pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping 
                   oil from his bronze body.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You got a lot of carbon scoring here. 
                             It looks like you boys have seen a 
                             lot of action.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             With all we've been through, sometimes 
                             I'm amazed we're in as good condition 
                             as we are, what with the Rebellion 
                             and all.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You know of the Rebellion against 
                             the Empire?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             That's how we came to be in your 
                             service, if you take my meaning, 
                             sir.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Have you been in many battles?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Several, I think. Actually, there's 
                             not much to tell. I'm not much more 
                             than an interpreter, and not very 
                             good at telling stories. Well, not 
                             at making them interesting, anyways.
    
                   Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's 
                   neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, my little friend, you've got 
                             something jammed in here real good. 
                             Were you on a cruiser or...
    
                   The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling 
                   head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
                   dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being 
                   projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a 
                   rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly 
                   lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                             only hope.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What's this?
    
                   Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio 
                   to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment 
                   over and over.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             What is what?!? He asked you a 
                             question...
                                  (pointing to Leia)
                             What is that?
    
                   Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice 
                   the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer 
                   for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the 
                   sentence fragment over and over.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                             only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
                             You're my only hope.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely 
                             a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no 
                             mind.
    
                   Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Who is she? She's beautiful.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I think she was a passenger on our 
                             last voyage. A person of some 
                             importance, sir -- I believe. Our 
                             captain was attached to...
    
                                         LUKE
                             Is there more to this recording?
    
                   Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic 
                   squeaks and a whistle.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going 
                             to get us in trouble. It's all right, 
                             you can trust him. He's our new 
                             master.
    
                   Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             He says he's the property of Obi-Wan 
                             Kenobi, a resident of these parts. 
                             And it's a private message for him. 
                             Quite frankly, sir I don't know what 
                             he's talking about. Our last master 
                             was Captain Antilles, but with what 
                             we've been through, this little R2 
                             unit has become a bit eccentric.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means 
                             old Ben Kenobi?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I beg your pardon, sir, but do you 
                             know what he's talking about?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
                             Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond 
                             the dune sea. He's kind of a strange 
                             old hermit.
    
                   Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few 
                   moments.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I wonder who she is. It sounds like 
                             she's in trouble. I'd better play 
                             back the whole thing.
    
                   Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             He says the restraining bolt has 
                             short circuited his recording system. 
                             He suggests that if you remove the 
                             bolt, he might be able to play back 
                             the entire recording.
    
                   Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't 
                   really heard what Threepio has been saying.
    
                                         LUKE
                             H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're 
                             too small to run away on me if I 
                             take this off! Okay.
    
                   Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off 
                   Artoo's side.
    
                                         LUKE
                             There you go.
    
                   The princess immediately disappears...
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? 
                             Bring her back! Play back the entire 
                             message.
    
                   Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in 
                   embarrassment.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             What message? The one you're carrying 
                             inside your rusty innards!
    
                   A women's voice calls out from another room.
    
                                         AUNT BERU
                             Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
    
                   Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning 
                   robot.
    
                                         LUKE
                             All right, I'll be right there, Aunt 
                             Beru.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to 
                             have picked up a slight flutter.
    
                   Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and 
                   hurries out of the room.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, see what you can do with him. 
                             I'll be right back.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                                  (to Artoo)
                             Just you reconsider playing that 
                             message for him.
    
                   Artoo beeps in response.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             No, I don't think he likes you at 
                             all.
    
                   Artoo beeps.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             No, I don't like you either.
    
                   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA
    
                   Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher 
                   with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
                   used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls 
                   of food and starts for the dining area.
    
                   Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with 
                   steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red 
                   grain.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You know, I think that R2 unit we 
                             bought might have been stolen.
    
                                         OWEN
                             What makes you think that?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, I stumbled across a recording 
                             while I was cleaning him. He says he 
                             belongs to someone called Obi-Wan 
                             Kenobi.
    
                   Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but 
                   manages to control himself.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I thought he might have meant old 
                             Ben. Do you know what he's talking 
                             about? Well, I wonder if he's related 
                             to Ben.
    
                   Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
    
                                         OWEN
                             That old man's just a crazy old 
                             wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take 
                             that R2 unit into Anchorhead and 
                             have its memory flushed. That'll be 
                             the end of it. It belongs to us now.
    
                                         LUKE
                             But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking 
                             for him?
    
                                         OWEN
                             He won't, I don't think he exists 
                             any more. He died about the same 
                             time as your father.
    
                                         LUKE
                             He knew my father?
    
                                         OWEN
                             I told you to forget it. Your only 
                             concern is to prepare the new droids 
                             for tomorrow. In the morning I want 
                             them on the south ridge working out 
                             those condensers.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Yes, sir. I think those new droids 
                             are going to work out fine. In fact, 
                             I, uh, was also thinking about our 
                             agreement about my staying on another 
                             season. And if these new droids do 
                             work out, I want to transmit my 
                             application to the Academy this year.
    
                   Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress 
                   it.
    
                                         OWEN
                             You mean the next semester before 
                             harvest?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Sure, there're more than enough 
                             droids.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Harvest is when I need you the most. 
                             Only one more season. This year we'll 
                             make enough on the harvest so I'll 
                             be able to hire some more hands. And 
                             then you can go to the Academy next 
                             year.
    
                   Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.
    
                                         OWEN
                             You must understand I need you here, 
                             Luke.
    
                                         LUKE
                             But it's a whole 'nother year.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Look, it's only one more season.
    
                   Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Yeah, that's what you said last year 
                             when Biggs and Tank left.
    
                                         AUNT BERU
                             Where are you going?
    
                                         LUKE
                             It looks like I'm going nowhere. I 
                             have to finish cleaning those droids.
    
                   Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen 
                   mechanically finishes his dinner.
    
                                         AUNT BERU
                             Owen, he can't stay here forever. 
                             Most of his friends have gone. It 
                             means so much to him.
    
                                         OWEN
                             I'll make it up to him next year. I 
                             promise.
    
                                         AUNT BERU
                             Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He 
                             has too much of his father in him.
    
                                         OWEN
                             That's what I'm afraid of.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
    
                   The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a 
                   distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few 
                   moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the 
                   homestead.
    
                   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE
    
                   Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in 
                   sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt 
                   similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the 
                   box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a 
                   short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What are you doing hiding there?
    
                   Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in 
                   sight.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't 
                             deactivate me. I told him not to go, 
                             but he's faulty, malfunctioning; 
                             kept babbling on about his mission.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Oh, no!
    
                   Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
    
                   Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead 
                   and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
                   robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the 
                   salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his 
                   electrobinoculars.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             That R2 unit has always been a 
                             problem. These astro-droids are 
                             getting quite out of hand. Even I 
                             can't understand their logic at times.
    
                                         LUKE
                             How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere 
                             in sight. Blast it!
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go 
                             after him?
    
                                         LUKE
                             It's too dangerous with all the 
                             Sandpeople around. We'll have to 
                             wait until morning.
    
                   Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Luke, I'm shutting the power down 
                             for the night.
    
                                         LUKE
                             All right, I'll be there in a few 
                             minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.
    
                   He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You know that little droid is going 
                             to cause me a lot of trouble.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Oh, he excels at that, sir.
    
                   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA
    
                   Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of 
                   the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of 
                   Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be 
                             loafing now!
    
                   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN
    
                   The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru 
                   prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Have you seen Luke this morning?
    
                                         AUNT BERU
                             He said he had some things to do 
                             before he started today, so he left 
                             early.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Uh? Did he take those two new droids 
                             with him?
    
                                         AUNT BERU
                             I think so.
    
                                         OWEN
                             Well, he'd better have those units 
                             in the south range repaired be midday 
                             or there'll be hell to pay!
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY
    
                   The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio 
                   pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast 
                   wasteland.
    
                   INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - 
                   DAY
    
                   Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something 
                   in the motor compartment.
    
                                         LUKE

                             How's that.
    
                   Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the 
                   wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this 
                             direction somewhere, but I don't see 
                             how that R2 unit could have come 
                             this far. We must have missed him. 
                             Uncle Owen isn't going to take this 
                             very well.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Sir, would it help if you told him 
                             it was my fault.
    
                                         LUKE

                             Sure. He needs you. He'd probably 
                             only deactivate you for a day or 
                             so...
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Deactivate! Well, on the other hand 
                             if you hadn't removed his restraining 
                             bolt...
    
                                         LUKE
                             Wait, there's something dead ahead 
                             on the scanner. It looks like our 
                             droid... hit the accelerator.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY
    
                   From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen 
                   gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground 
                   two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert 
                   cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the 
                   marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle 
                   and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs 
                   the gun before it can be fired.
    
                   The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, 
                   speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an 
                   animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in 
                   the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON
    
                   The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied 
                   to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large 
                   as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, 
                   and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders 
                   mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs 
                   and ride off down the rugged bluff.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR
    
                   The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, 
                   with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands 
                   before little Artoo.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Hey, whoa, just where do you think 
                             you're going?
    
                   The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses 
                   menacingly behind the little runaway.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Master Luke here is your rightful 
                             owner. We'll have no more of this 
                             Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't 
                             talk to me about your mission, either. 
                             You're fortunate he doesn't blast 
                             you into a million pieces right here.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, come on. It's getting late. I 
                             only hope we can get back before 
                             Uncle Owen really blows up.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             If you don't mind my saying so, sir, 
                             I think you should deactivate the 
                             little fugitive until you've gotten 
                             him back to your workshop.
    
                                         LUKE
                             No, he's not going to try anything.
    
                   Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic 
                   whistles and screams.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What's wrong with him now?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Oh my... sir, he says there are 
                             several creatures approaching from 
                             the southeast.
    
                   Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's 
                             have a look. Come on.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY
    
                   Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and 
                   scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the 
                   two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young 
                   adventurer.
    
                                         LUKE
                             There are two Banthas down there but 
                             I don't see any... wait a second, 
                             they're Sandpeople all right. I can 
                             see one of them now.
    
                   Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his 
                   electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of 
                   his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, 
                   gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled 
                   and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be 
                   heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles 
                   down the side of the mountain.
    
                   The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed 
                   gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in 
                   the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block 
                   the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. 
                   The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced 
                   to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands 
                   over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible 
                   shrieking laugh.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY
    
                   Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in 
                   the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the 
                   inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the 
                   speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts 
                   and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then 
                   everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan 
                   is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the 
                   Sandpeople fleeing in terror.
    
                   Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight 
                   swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even 
                   closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and 
                   leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and 
                   weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating 
                   eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes 
                   as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a 
                   slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.
    
                                         BEN
                             Hello there! Come here my little 
                             friend. Don't be afraid.
    
                   Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and 
                   begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on 
                   Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.
    
                                         BEN
                             Don't worry, he'll be all right.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What happened?
    
                                         BEN
                             Rest easy, son, you've had a busy 
                             day. You're fortunate you're still 
                             in one piece.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to 
                             see you!
    
                                         BEN
                             The Jundland wastes are not to be 
                             traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, 
                             what brings you out this far?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Oh, this little droid! I think he's 
                             searching for his former master... 
                             I've never seen such devotion in a 
                             droid before... there seems to be no 
                             stopping him. He claims to be the 
                             property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he 
                             a relative of yours? Do you know who 
                             he's talking about?
    
                   Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.
    
                                         BEN
                             Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats 
                             a name I haven't heard in a long 
                             time... a long time.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I think my uncle knew him. He said 
                             he was dead.
    
                                         BEN
                             Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You know him!
    
                                         BEN
                             Well of course, of course I know 
                             him. He's me! I haven't gone by the 
                             name Obi-Wan since oh, before you 
                             were born.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Then the droid does belong to you.
    
                                         BEN
                             Don't seem to remember ever owning a 
                             droid. Very interesting...
    
                   He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
    
                                         BEN
                             I think we better get indoors. The 
                             Sandpeople are easily startled but 
                             they will soon be back and in greater 
                             numbers.
    
                   Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic 
                   beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.
    
                                         LUKE

                   EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY
    
                   Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins 
                   to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and 
                   Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half 
                   buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.
    
                   Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then 
                   flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally 
                   the mechanical man's systems turn on.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Where am I? I must have taken a bad 
                             step...
    
                                         LUKE
                             Can you stand? We've got to get out 
                             of here before the Sandpeople return.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I don't think I can make it. You go 
                             on, Master Luke. There's no sense in 
                             you risking yourself on my account. 
                             I'm done for.
    
                   Artoo makes a beeping sound.
    
                                         LUKE
                             No, you're not. What kind of talk is 
                             that?
    
                   Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little 
                   Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around 
                   suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the 
                   air.
    
                                         BEN
                             Quickly, son... they're on the move.
    
                   INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING
    
                   The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but 
                   still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and 
                   security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as 
                   old Ben sits thinking.
    
                                         LUKE
                             No, my father didn't fight in the

                             That's what your uncle told you. He 
                             didn't hold with your father's ideals. 
                             Thought he should have stayed here 
                             and not gotten involved.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You fought in the Clone Wars?
    
                                         BEN
                             Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the 
                             same as your father.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I wish I'd known him.
    
                                         BEN
                             He was the best star-pilot in the 
                             galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I 
                             understand you've become quite a 
                             good pilot yourself. And he was a 
                             good friend. Which reminds me...
    
                   Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  
                   As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the 
                   restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  
                   Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the 
                   table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle 
                   with several electronic gadgets attached to it.
    
                                         BEN
                             I have something here for you. Your 
                             father wanted you to have this when 
                             you were old enough, but your uncle 
                             wouldn't allow it. He feared you 
                             might follow old Obi-Wan on some 
                             damned-fool idealistic crusade like 
                             your father did.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Sir, if you'll not be needing me, 
                             I'll close down for awhile.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Sure, go ahead.
    
                   Ben hands Luke the saber.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What is it?
    
                                         BEN
                             Your fathers lightsaber. This is the 
                             weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy 
                             or as random as a blaster.
    
                   Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out 
                   about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across 
                   the ceiling.

                             An elegant weapon for a more civilized 
                             time. For over a thousand generations 
                             the Jedi Knights were the guardians 
                             of peace and justice in the Old 
                             Republic. Before the dark times, 
                             before the Empire.
    
                   Luke hasn't really been listening.

                             How did my father die?

                             A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who 
                             was a pupil of mine until he turned 
                             to evil, helped the Empire hunt down 
                             and destroy the Jedi Knights. He 
                             betrayed and murdered your father. 
                             Now the Jedi are all but extinct. 
                             Vader was seduced by the dark side 
                             of the Force.

                             Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi 
                             his power. It's an energy field 
                             created by all living things. It 
                             surrounds us and penetrates us. It 
                             binds the galaxy together.
    
                   Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                             out what you are, my little friend. 
                             And where you come from.

                             I saw part of the message he was...
    
                   Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful 
                   young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

                             I seem to have found it.
    
                   Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before 
                   his eyes.
    
                                         LEIA
                             General Kenobi, years ago you served 
                             my father in the Clone Wars. Now he 
                             begs you to help him in his struggle 
                             against the Empire. I regret that I 
                             am unable to present my father's 
                             request to you in person, but my 
                             ship has fallen under attack and I'm 
                             afraid my mission to bring you to 
                             Alderaan has failed. I have placed 
                             information vital to the survival of 
                             the Rebellion into the memory systems 
                             of this R2 unit. My father will know 
                             how to retrieve it. You must see 
                             this droid safely delivered to him 
                             on Alderaan. This is our most 
                             desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan 
                             Kenobi, you're my only hope.
    
                   There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  
                   Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs 
                   on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

                             You must learn the ways of the Force

                             Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. 
                             I've got to go home. It's late, I'm 
                             in for it as it is.

                             your help. I'm getting too old for 
                             this sort of thing.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I can't get involved! I've got work 
                             to do! It's not that I like the 
                             Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing 
                             I can do about it right now. It's 
                             such a long way from here.

                             Anchorhead. You can get a transport 
                             there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're 
                             going.

                   An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like 
                   battle station: the Death Star!
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
    
                   Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black 
                   conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around 
                   the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, 
                   is speaking.
    
                                         TAGGE
                             Until this battle station is fully 
                             operational we are vulnerable. The 
                             Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. 
                             They're more dangerous than you 
                             realize.
    
                   The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
    
                                         MOTTI
                             Dangerous to your starfleet, 
                             Commander, not to this battle station!
    
                                         TAGGE
                             The Rebellion will continue to gain 
                             a support in the Imperial Senate as 
                             long as....
    
                   Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut 
                   short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial 
                   outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, 
                   The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and 
                   bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his 
                   place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind 
                   him.
    
                                         TARKIN
                             The Imperial Senate will no longer 
                             be of any concern to us. I've just 
                             received word that the Emperor has 
                             dissolved the council permanently. 
                             The last remnants of the Old Republic 
                             have been swept away.
    
                                         TAGGE
                             That's impossible! How will the 
                             Emperor maintain control without the 
                             bureaucracy?
    
                                         TARKIN
                             The regional governors now have direct 
                             control over territories. Fear will 
                             keep the local systems in line. Fear 
                             of this battle station.
    
                                         TAGGE
                             And what of the Rebellion? If the 
                             Rebels have obtained a complete 
                             technical readout of this station, 
                             it is possible, however unlikely, 
                             that they might find a weakness and 
                             exploit it.

                             The plans you refer to will soon be

                             Any attack made by the Rebels against 
                             this station would be a useless 
                             gesture, no matter what technical 
                             data they've obtained. This station 
                             is now the ultimate power in the 
                             universe. I suggest we use it!

                             Don't be too proud of this 
                             technological terror you've 
                             constructed. The ability to destroy 
                             a planet is insignificant next to 
                             the power of the Force.
    
                                         MOTTI
                             Don't try to frighten us with your 
                             sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your 
                             sad devotion to that ancient religion 
                             has not helped you conjure up the 
                             stolen data tapes, or given you 
                             clairvoyance enough to find the 
                             Rebel's hidden fort...
    
                   Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's 
                   spell.

                             Vader will provide us with the 
                             location of the Rebel fortress by 
                             the time this station is operational. 
                             We will then crush the Rebellion 
                             with one swift stroke.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
    
                   The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas 
                   Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble 
                   and scattered bodies.
    
                                         LUKE
                             It looks like Sandpeople did this, 
                             all right. Look, here are Gaffi 
                             sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... 
                             I never heard of them hitting anything 
                             this big before.
    
                   Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
    
                                         BEN
                             They didn't. But we are meant to 
                             think they did. These tracks are 
                             side by side. Sandpeople always ride 
                             single file to hide there numbers.
    
                                         LUKE
                             These are the same Jawas that sold 
                             us Artoo and Threepio.
    
                                         BEN
                             And these blast points, too accurate 
                             for Sandpeople. Only Imperial 
                             stormtroopers are so precise.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Why would Imperial troops want to 
                             slaughter Jawas?
    
                   Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are 
                   inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.
    
                                         LUKE
                             If they traced the robots here, they 
                             may have learned who they sold them 
                             to. And that would lead them home!
    
                   Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for 
                   the speeder and jumps it.
    
                                         BEN
                             Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.
    
                   Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the 
                   burning Sandcrawler.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
    
                   Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
    
                   The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps 
                   out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. 
                   Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great 
                   battle has taken place.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
    
                   Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. 
                   Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is 
                   stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new 
                   resolve comes over him.

                   Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow 
                   several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is 
                   filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a 
                   giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

                             And, now Your Highness, we will 
                             discuss the location of your hidden 
                             Rebel base.
    
                   The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it 
                   approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical 
                   arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut 
                   and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled 
                   screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
    
                   There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of 
                   the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the 
                   dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to 
                   him.
    
                                         BEN

                             Luke, had you been there. You'd have 
                             been killed, too, and the droids 
                             would be in the hands of the Empire.

                             I want to come with you to Alderaan. 
                             There's nothing here for me now. I 
                             want to learn the ways of the Force 
                             and become a Jedi like my father.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
    
                   The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it 
                   zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff 
                   overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard 
                   array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A 
                   harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts 
                   his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where 
                   Ben is standing.

                             and villainy. We must be cautious.
    
                   Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined 
                   smile.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
    
                   The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
                   hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper 
                   questions Luke.

                   Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while 
                   Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

                   The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina 
                   on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of 
                   transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are 
                   parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle 
                   the speeder.

                   As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa 
                   away.

                   The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow 
                   Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy 
                   den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic 
                   alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At 
                   first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, 
                   furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over 
                   drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group 
                   of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender 
                   stops Luke and the robots.
    
                                         BARTENDER

                   Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many 
                   outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's 
                   drift.

                   Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the 
                   Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures 
                   along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
    
                   Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

                             the speeder. We don't want any 
                             trouble.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I heartily agree with you sir.
    
                   Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the 
                   creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
    
                   Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
                   looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with 
                   fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
                   covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  
                   Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, 
                   and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a 
                   sight to behold.
    
                   Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times 
                   during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets 
                   out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit 
                   disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between 
                   Ben and the giant Wookiee.
    
                   Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips 
                   his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear 
                   or whatever.
    
                   A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.
    
                                         CREATURE
                             Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
    
                   The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore 
                   the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby 
                   Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the 
                   belligerent monstrosity.
    
                                         HUMAN
                             He doesn't like you.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I'm sorry.
    
                                         HUMAN
                             I don't like you either.
    
                   The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some 
                   unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young 
                   adventurer.
    
                                         HUMAN
                             Don't insult us. You just watch 
                             yourself. We're wanted men. I have 
                             the death sentence in twelve systems.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I'll be careful than.
    
                                         HUMAN
                             You'll be dead.
    
                   The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar 
                   moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His 
                   three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind 
                   Luke.
    
                                         BEN
                             This little one isn't worth the 
                             effort. Come let me buy you 
                             something...
    
                   A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young 
                   would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables 
                   and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. 
                   With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked 
                   chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. 
                   The bartender panics.
    
                                         BARTENDER
                             No blasters! No blaster!
    
                   With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life 
                   and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut 
                   in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, 
                   cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns 
                   off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. 
                   Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, 
                   attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter 
                   of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is 
                   given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing 
                   his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben 
                   points the the Wookiee.
    
                                         BEN
                             This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate 
                             on a ship that might suit our needs.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
    
                   Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on 
                   an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
                   droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches 
                   two stormtroopers in the street.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I don't like the look of this.
    
                   INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA
    
                   Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking 
                   instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and 
                   follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is 
                   sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years 
                   old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, 
                   and cocksure.
    
                                         HAN
                             Han Solo. I'm captain of the 
                             Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells 
                             me you're looking for passage to the 
                             Alderaan system.
    
                                         BEN
                             Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.
    
                                         HAN
                             Fast ship? You've never heard of the 
                             Millennium Falcon?
    
                                         BEN
                             Should I have?
    
                                         HAN
                             It's the ship that made the Kessel 
                             run in less than twelve parsecs!
    
                   Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with 
                   obvious misinformation.
    
                                         HAN
                             I've outrun Imperial starships, not 
                             the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. 
                             I'm talking about the big Corellian 
                             ships now. She's fast enough for 
                             you, old man. What's the cargo?
    
                                         BEN
                             Only passengers. Myself, the boy, 
                             two droids, and no questions asked.
    
                                         HAN
                             What is it? Some kind of local 
                             trouble?
    
                                         BEN
                             Let's just say we'd like to avoid 
                             any Imperial entanglements.
    
                                         HAN
                             Well, that's the trick, isn't it? 
                             And it's going to cost you something 
                             extra. Ten thousand in advance.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Ten thousand? We could almost buy 
                             our own ship for that!
    
                                         HAN
                             But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
    
                                         LUKE
                             You bet I could. I'm not such a bad 
                             pilot myself! We don't have to sit 
                             here and listen...
    
                                         BEN
                             We haven't that much with us. But we 
                             could pay you two thousand now, plus 
                             fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
    
                                         HAN
                             Seventeen, huh!
    
                   Han ponders this for a few moments.
    
                                         HAN
                             Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. 
                             We'll leave as soon as you're ready. 
                             Docking bay Ninety-four.
    
                                         BEN
                             Ninety-four.
    
                                         HAN
                             Looks like somebody's beginning to 
                             take an interest in your handiwork.
    
                   Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers 
                   looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some 
                   questions. The bartender points to the booth.
    
                                         TROOPER
                             All right, we'll check it out.
    
                   The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben 
                   are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.
    
                                         HAN
                             Seventeen thousand! Those guys must 
                             really be desperate. This could really 
                             save my neck. Get back to the ship 
                             and get her ready.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
    
                                         BEN
                             You'll have to sell your speeder.
    
                                         LUKE
                             That's okay. I'm never coming back 
                             to this planet again.
    
                   INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA
    
                   As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
                   with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature 
                   speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
    
                                         GREEDO
                             Going somewhere, Solo?
    
                                         HAN
                             Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I 
                             was just going to see your boss. 
                             Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
    
                   Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the 
                   gun on him.
    
                                         GREEDO
                             It's too late. You should have paid 
                             him when you had the chance. Jabba's 
                             put a price on your head, so large 
                             that every bounty hunter in the galaxy 
                             will be looking for you. I'm lucky I 
                             found you first.
    
                                         HAN
                             Yeah, but this time I got the money.
    
                                         GREEDO
                             If you give it to me, I might forget 
                             I found you.
    
                                         HAN
                             I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
    
                                         GREEDO
                             Jabba's through with you. He has no 
                             time for smugglers who drop their 
                             shipments at the first sign of an 
                             Imperial cruiser.
    
                                         HAN
                             Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you 
                             think I had a choice?
    
                   Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
    
                                         GREEDO
                             You can tell that to Jabba. He may 
                             only take your ship.
    
                                         HAN
                             Over my dead body.
    
                                         GREEDO
                             That's the idea. I've been looking 
                             forward to killing you for a long 
                             time.
    
                                         HAN
                             Yes, I'll bet you have.
    
                   Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of 
                   light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as 
                   the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up 
                   and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some 
                   coins as he leaves.
    
                                         HAN
                             Sorry about the mess.

                   Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a 
                   narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking 
                   exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and 
                   robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and 
                   hiding from the hot winds.

                             Lock the door, Artoo.
    
                   One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves 
                   on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and 
                   Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.
    
                                         TROOPER
                             All right, check that side of the 
                             street. It's secure. Move on to the 
                             next door.
    
                   The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

                             I would much rather have gone with 
                             Master Luke than stay here with you. 
                             I don't know what all the trouble is 
                             about, but I'm sure it must be your 
                             fault.
    
                   Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                   SPEEDER LOT
    
                   Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, 
                   talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder 
                   dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass 
                   by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.
    
                                         LUKE
                             He says it's the best he can do. 
                             Since the XP-38 came out, they're 
                             just not in demand.

                             It will be enough.
    
                   Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty 
                   alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like 
                   creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his 
                   faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature 
                   moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as 
                   they disappear down another alley.

                   Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple 
                   creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is 
                   the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is 
                   a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is 
                   a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and 
                   a huge ugly mouth.
    
                                         JABBA
                             Come on out, Solo!
    
                   A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and 
                   they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, 
                   Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.
    
                                         HAN
                             I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
    
                                         JABBA
                             I expected you would be.
    
                                         HAN
                             I'm not the type to run.

                                  (fatherly-smooth)
                             Han, my boy, there are times when 
                             you disappoint me... why haven't you 
                             paid me? And why did you have to fry 
                             poor Greedo like that... after all 
                             we've been through together.
    
                                         HAN
                             You sent Greedo to blast me.
    
                                         JABBA
                                  (mock surprise)
                             Han, why you're the best smuggler in 
                             the business. You're too valuable to 
                             fry. He was only relaying my concern 
                             at your delays. He wasn't going to 
                             blast you.
    
                                         HAN
                             I think he thought he was. Next time 
                             don't send one of those twerps. If 
                             you've got something to say to me, 
                             come see me yourself.
    
                                         JABBA
                             Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to 
                             dump that shipment of spice... you 
                             understand I just can't make an 
                             exception. Where would I be if every 
                             pilot who smuggled for me dumped 
                             their shipment at the first sign of 
                             an Imperial starship? It's not good 
                             business.
    
                                         HAN
                             You know, even I get boarded 
                             sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, 
                             but I've got a charter now and I can 
                             pay you back, plus a little extra. I 
                             just need some more time.
    
                                         JABBA
                                  (to his men)
                             Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, 
                             I'm only doing this because you're 
                             the best and I need you. So, for an 
                             extra, say twenty percent I'll give 
                             you a little more time... but this 
                             is it. If you disappoint me again, 
                             I'll put a price on your head so 
                             large you won't be able to go near a 
                             civilized system for the rest of 
                             your short life.

                             Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my

                   Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 
                   94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.  
                   Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. 
                   The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder 
                   lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small 
                   transmitter.

                   Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is 
                   Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a 
                   large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that 
                   could only loosely be called a starship.

                             What a piece of junk.
    
                   The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

                             She'll make point five beyond the 
                             speed of light. She may not look 
                             like much, but she's got it where it 
                             counts, kid. I've added some special 
                             modifications myself.
    
                   Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about 
                   all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others 
                   to follow.
    
                                         HAN
                             We're a little rushed, so if you'll 
                             hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
    
                   The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han 
                   Solo.

                   Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing 
                   into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as 
                   he ducks into the spaceship.

                             Blast 'em!
    
                   Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots 
                   which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The 
                   pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that 
                   slams the overhead entry shut.

                             Chewie, get us out of here!
    
                   The group straps in for take off.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I 
                             hate space travel.
    
                   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS
    
                   The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general 
                   alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above 
                   the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the 
                   morning sky.
    
                   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
    
                   Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who 
                   chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.
    
                   EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE
    
                   The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.
    
                   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
    
                   Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.  
                   Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, 
                   makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.
    
                                         HAN
                             It looks like an Imperial cruiser. 
                             Our passengers must be hotter than I 
                             thought. Try and hold them off. Angle 
                             the deflector shield while I make 
                             the calculations for the jump to 
                             light speed.
    
                   EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE
    
                   The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow 
                   planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial 
                   stardestroyers.
    
                   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
    
                   Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy 
                   spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the 
                   cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.
    
                                         HAN
                             Stay sharp! There are two more coming 
                             in; they're going to try to cut us 
                             off.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Why don't you outrun them? I thought 
                             you said this thing was fast.
    
                                         HAN
                             Watch your mouth, kid, or you're 
                             going to find yourself floating home. 
                             We'll be safe enough once we make 
                             the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I 
                             know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 
                             them!
    
                   EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE
    
                   Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.

                   The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.
    
                                         HAN
                             Here's where the fun begins!
    
                                         BEN
                             How long before you can make the 
                             jump to light speed?
    
                                         HAN
                             It'll take a few moments to get the 
                             coordinates from the navi-computer.
    
                   The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Are you kidding? At the rate they're 
                             gaining...
    
                                         HAN
                             Traveling through hyperspace isn't 
                             like dusting crops, boy! Without 
                             precise calculations we could fly 
                             right through a star or bounce too 
                             close to a supernova and that'd end 
                             your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
    
                   The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red 
                   warning light begins to flash.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What's that flashing?
    
                                         HAN
                             We're losing our deflector shield. 
                             Go strap yourself in, I'm going to 
                             make the jump to light speed.
    
                   The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if 
                   crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship 
                   makes the jump to hyperspace.

                   The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a

                   Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM
    
                   Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before 
                   Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen 
                   displaying a small green planet.
    
                                         MOTTI
                             We've entered the Alderaan system.
    
                   Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her 
                   hands are bound.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Governor Tarkin, I should have 
                             expected to find you holding Vader's 
                             leash. I recognized your foul stench 
                             when I was brought on board.
    
                                         TARKIN
                             Charming to the last. You don't know 
                             how hard I found it signing the order 
                             to terminate your life!
    
                                         LEIA
                             I surprised you had the courage to 
                             take the responsibility yourself!
    
                                         TARKIN
                             Princess Leia, before your execution 
                             I would like you to be my guest at a 
                             ceremony that will make this battle 
                             station operational. No star system 
                             will dare oppose the Emperor now.
    
                                         LEIA
                             The more you tighten your grip, 
                             Tarkin, the more star systems will 
                             slip through your fingers.
    
                                         TARKIN
                             Not after we demonstrate the power 
                             of this station. In a way, you have 
                             determined the choice of the planet 
                             that'll be destroyed first. Since 
                             you are reluctant to provide us with 
                             the location of the Rebel base, I 
                             have chosen to test this station's 
                             destructive power... on your home 
                             planet of Alderaan.
    
                                         LEIA
                             No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no 
                             weapons. You can't possibly...
    
                                         TARKIN
                             You would prefer another target? A 
                             military target? Then name the system!
    
                   Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.
    
                                         TARKIN
                             I grow tired of asking this. So it'll 
                             be the last time. Where is the Rebel 
                             base?
    
                   Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to 
                   Alderaan.

                             Dantooine.
    
                   Leia lowers her head.
    
                                         LEIA
                             They're on Dantooine.
    
                                         TARKIN
                             There. You see Lord Vader, she can 
                             be reasonable.
                                  (addressing Motti)
                             Continue with the operation. You may 
                             fire when ready.

                             What?
    
                                         TARKIN
                             You're far too trusting. Dantooine 
                             is too remote to make an effective 
                             demonstration. But don't worry. We 
                             will deal with your Rebel friends 
                             soon enough.

                   A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A 
                   hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  
                   Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another 
                   lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A 
                   huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area 
                   and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. 
                   The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

                   Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" 
                   robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, 
                   seems almost faint.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Are you all right? What's wrong?

                             I felt a great disturbance in the 
                             Force... as if millions of voices 
                             suddenly cried out in terror and 
                             were suddenly silenced. I fear 
                             something terrible has happened.
    
                   Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then 
                   he fixes his gaze on Luke.

                             You'd better get on with your

                             with those Imperial slugs. I told 
                             you I'd outrun 'em.
    
                   Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

                   Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a 
                   game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move 
                   along a chess-type board.

                             Anyway, we should be at Alderaan 
                             about oh-two-hundred hours.
    
                   Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table 
                   covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the 
                   table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca 
                   seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- 
                   covered arms over his head.

                             Now be careful, Artoo.
    
                   Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his 
                   stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures 
                   to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's 
                   face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. 
                   Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and 
                   begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             He made a fair move. Screaming about 
                             it won't help you.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (interrupting)
                             Let him have it. It's not wise to 
                             upset a Wookiee.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             But sir, nobody worries about 
                             upsetting a droid.
    
                                         HAN
                             That's 'cause droids don't pull 
                             people's arms out of their socket 
                             when they lose. Wookiees are known 
                             to do that.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I see your point, sir. I suggest a 
                             new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee 
                             win.
    
                   Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems 
                   frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his 
                   head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  
                   Han watches with a bit of smugness.
    
                                         BEN
                             Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force 
                             flowing through him.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You mean it controls your actions?

                             Partially. But it also obeys your 
                             commands.
    
                   Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a 
                   "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, 
                   hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of 
                   the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift 
                   lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't 
                   move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, 
                   then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood 
                   red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing 
                   him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

                             are no match for a good blaster at 
                             your side, kid.
    
                                         LUKE

                             you?

                             Kid, I've flown from one side of 
                             this galaxy to the other. I've seen 
                             a lot of strange stuff, but I've 
                             never seen anything to make me believe 
                             there's one all-powerful force 
                             controlling everything. There's no 
                             mystical energy field that controls 
                             my destiny.
    
                   Ben smiles quietly.
    
                                         HAN
                             It's all a lot of simple tricks and 
                             nonsense.
    
                                         BEN
                             I suggest you try it again, Luke.
    
                   Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his 
                   eyes.
    
                                         BEN
                             This time, let go your conscious 
                             self and act on instinct.
    
                                         LUKE
                                  (laughing)
                             With the blast shield down, I can't 
                             even see. How am I supposed to fight?
    
                                         BEN
                             Your eyes can deceive you. Don't 
                             trust them.
    
                   Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker 
                   into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then 
                   drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly 
                   missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits 
                   Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful 
                   yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
    
                                         BEN
                             Stretch out with your feelings.
    
                   Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes 
                   a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the 
                   bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original 
                   position.
    
                                         BEN
                             You see, you can do it.

                             thing as luck.

                             one thing. Going good against the 
                             living? That's something else.
    
                   Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the 
                   control panel.

                             Alderaan.
    
                   Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
    
                                         LUKE
                             You know, I did feel something. I 
                             could almost see the remote.

                             That's good. You have taken your 
                             first step into a larger world.

                   evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.

                             Our scout ships have reached 
                             Dantooine. They found the remains of 
                             a Rebel base, but they estimate that 
                             it has been deserted for some time. 
                             They are now conducting an extensive 
                             search of the surrounding systems.

                             betray the Rebellion.
    
                                         TARKIN

                   The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange 
                   surreal light show surrounds the ship.

                   Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window 
                   stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then 
                   stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently 
                   shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering 
                   the sides of the ship.

                             Some kind of asteroid collision. 
                             It's not on any of the charts.
    
                   The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool 
                   in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing 
                   cockpit.

                   settle down.

                   A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled 
                   alarm starts humming.

                   Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside 
                   the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned 
                   Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.

                   The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the 
                   vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.

                   The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny 
                   fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter 
                   until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben 
                   stands behind Chewbacca.

                   The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as

                   spherical battle station.

                   toward the gargantuan battle station.

                   In a very small command office near the entrance to the 
                   pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices 
                   the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

                   A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and 
                   waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating 
                   his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his 
                   head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an 
                   annoyed look.

                             transmitter. I'll see what I can do.
    
                   As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing 
                   the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary 
                   state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling 
                   howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. 
                   The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted 
                   by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the 
                   robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed 
                   as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

                   the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it

                   Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
    
                                         BEN
                             Plug in. He should be able to 
                             interpret the entire Imperial computer 
                             network.
    
                   Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the 
                   vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information 
                   to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             He says he's found the main computer 
                             to power the tractor beam that's 
                             holding the ship here. He'll try to 
                             make the precise location appear on 
                             the monitor.
    
                   The computer monitor flashes readouts.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             The tractor beam is coupled to the 
                             main reactor in seven locations. A 
                             power loss at one of the terminals 
                             will allow the ship to leave.
    
                   Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
    
                                         BEN
                             I don't think you boys can help. I 
                             must go alone.
    
                                         HAN
                             Whatever you say. I've done more 
                             that I bargained for on this trip 
                             already.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I want to go with you.
    
                                         BEN
                             Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch 
                             over the droids.
    
                                         LUKE
                             But he can...
    
                                         BEN
                             They must be delivered safely or 
                             other star systems will suffer the 
                             same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny 
                             lies along a different path than 
                             mine. The Force will be with you... 
                             always!
    
                   Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps 
                   out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey 
                   hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head 
                   in agreement.
    
                                         HAN
                             Boy you said it, Chewie.
    
                   Han looks at Luke.
    
                                         HAN
                             Where did you dig up that old fossil?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Ben is a great man.
    
                                         HAN
                             Yeah, great at getting us into 
                             trouble.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I didn't hear you give any ideas...
    
                                         HAN
                             Well, anything would be better than 
                             just hanging around waiting for him 
                             to pick us up...
    
                                         LUKE
                             Who do you think...
    
                   Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  
                   Luke goes over to him.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What is it?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. 
                             He says "I found her", and keeps 
                             repeating, "She's here."
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, who... who has he found?
    
                   Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Princess Leia.
    
                                         LUKE
                             The princess? She's here?
    
                                         HAN
                             Princess? What's going on?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
                             three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to 
                             be terminated.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Oh, no! We've got to do something.
    
                                         HAN
                             What are you talking about?
    
                                         LUKE
                             The droid belongs to her. She's the 
                             one in the message... We've got to 
                             help her.
    
                                         HAN
                             Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. 
                             The old man wants us to wait right 
                             here.
    
                                         LUKE
                             But he didn't know she was here. 
                             Look, will you just find a way back 
                             into the detention block?
    
                                         HAN
                             I'm not going anywhere.
    
                                         LUKE
                             They're going to execute her. Look, 
                             a few minutes ago you said you didn't 
                             want to just wait here to be captured. 
                             Now all you want to do is stay.
    
                                         HAN
                             Marching into the detention area is 
                             not what I had in mind.
    
                                         LUKE
                             But they're going to kill her!
    
                                         HAN
                             Better her than me...
    
                                         LUKE
                             She's rich.
    
                   Chewbacca growls.
    
                                         HAN
                             Rich?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you 
                             were to rescue her, the reward would 
                             be...
    
                                         HAN
                             What?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well more wealth that you can imagine.
    
                                         HAN
                             I don't know, I can imagine quite a 
                             bit!
    
                                         LUKE
                             You'll get it!
    
                                         HAN
                             I better!
    
                                         LUKE
                             You will...
    
                                         HAN
                             All right, kid. But you'd better be 
                             right about this.
    
                   Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.
    
                                         LUKE
                             All right.
    
                                         HAN
                             What's your plan?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders 
                             there will you?
    
                   Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on 
                             you.
    
                   Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Okay. Han, you put these on.
    
                   Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
    
                                         HAN
                             Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know 
                             what he has in mind.
    
                   The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as 
                   Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for 
                             asking... but, ah... what should 
                             Artoo and I do if we're discovered 
                             here?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Lock the door!
    
                                         HAN
                             And hope they don't have blasters.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             That isn't very reassuring.
    
                   Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and 
                   start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE
    
                   Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits 
                   as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, 
                   bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio 
                   completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious 
                   glance.
    
                   Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I can't see a thing in this helmet.
    
                   A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away 
                   by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and 
                   the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY
    
                   Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main 
                   passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot 
                   similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end 
                   of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then 
                   disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting 
                   that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. 
                   No one in the hallway seems to notice him.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY 
                   AREA
    
                   Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door 
                   slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards 
                   enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates 
                   are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
    
                                         HAN
                             This is not going to work.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Why didn't you say so before?
    
                                         HAN
                             I did say so before!
    
                   INT. DETENTION AREA
    
                   Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches 
                   the trio.
    
                                         OFFICER
                             Where are you taking this... thing?
    
                   Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut 
                   up.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
                             three-eight.
    
                                         OFFICER
                             I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear 
                             it.
    
                   The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in 
                   the information. There are only three other troopers in the 
                   area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the 
                   alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of 
                   Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
    
                   Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one 
                   of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.
    
                                         HAN
                             Look out! He's loose!
    
                                         LUKE
                             He's going to pull us all apart.
    
                                         HAN
                             Go get him!
    
                   The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and 
                   Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are 
                   blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of 
                   laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser 
                   gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the 
                   last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is 
                   about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink 
                   system, which is screeching questions about what is going 
                   on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.
    
                                         HAN
                             We've got to find out which cell 
                             this princess of yours is in. Here 
                             it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. 
                             You go get her. I'll hold them here.
    
                   Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into 
                   the buzzing comlink.
    
                                         HAN

                   Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door 
                   away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees 
                   the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping 
                   and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on 
                   her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands 
                   staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

                   Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

                   Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the 
                   far end of the conference table.

                   A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door 
                   through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.
    
                   Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke 
                   and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting 
                   up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

                   are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far

                   fills the narrow cell corridor.

                             Well, I didn't...
    
                   The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in 
                   the wall next to Han, almost frying him.
    
                                         HAN
                             What the hell are you doing?
    
                                         LEIA
                             Somebody has to save our skins. Into 
                             the garbage chute, wise guy.
    
                   She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca 
                   look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and 
                   says something.
    
                                         HAN
                             Get in there you big furry oaf! I 
                             don't care what you smell! Get in 
                             there and don't worry about it.
    
                   Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the 
                   tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their 
                   way toward the opening.
    
                                         HAN
                             Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to 
                             kill her or I'm beginning to like 
                             her. Get in there!
    
                   Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires 
                   off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then 
                   slides into the chute himself and is gone.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
    
                   Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  
                   Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He 
                   finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't 
                   budge.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (sarcastically)
                             Oh! The garbage chute was a really 
                             wonderful idea. What an incredible 
                             smell you've discovered! Let's get 
                             out of here! Get away from there...
    
                                         LUKE
                             No! wait!
    
                   Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The 
                   laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  
                   Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes 
                   almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a 
                   rather grim look on her face.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Will you forget it? I already tried 
                             it. It's magnetically sealed!
    
                                         LEIA

                             get us all killed.
    
                                         HAN
                             Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I 
                             had everything under control until 
                             you led us down here. You know, it's 
                             not going to take them long to figure 
                             out what happened to us.

                             It could be worse...
    
                   A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the 
                   murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins 
                   to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols 
                   drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.
    
                                         HAN
                             It's worse.
    
                                         LUKE
                             There's something alive in here!
    
                                         HAN
                             That's your imagination.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Something just moves past my leg! 
                             Look! Did you see that?
    
                                         HAN
                             What?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Help!
    
                   Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.
    
                                         HAN
                             Luke! Luke! Luke!
    
                   Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air 
                   and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around 
                   his throat.

                             Luke!
    
                   Leia extends a long pipe toward him.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.
    
                                         HAN
                             Where?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Anywhere! Oh!!
    
                   Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the 
                   muck by the slimy tentacle.
    
                                         HAN
                             Luke! Luke!
    
                   Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and 
                   move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  
                   Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca 
                   howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke 
                   suddenly bobs to the surface.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Grab him!
    
                   Luke seems to be released by the thing.
    
                                         LEIA
                             What happened?
    
                                         LUKE
                             I don't know, it just let go of me 
                             and disappeared...
    
                                         HAN
                             I've got a very bad feeling about 
                             this.
    
                   Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and 
                   edge toward the Rebels.
    
                                         LUKE
                             The walls are moving!
    
                                         LEIA
                             Don't just stand there. Try to brace 
                             it with something.
    
                   They place poles and long metal beams between the closing 
                   walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant 
                   trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Wait a minute!
    
                   Luke pulls out his comlink.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! 
                             Where could he be?
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE
    
                   A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for 
                   See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which 
                   is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and 
                   Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great 
                   explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the 
                   floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.
    
                                         FIRST TROOPER
                             Take over!

                                  officer)
                             See to him! Look there!
    
                   A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides 
                   open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows 
                   his bronze companion out into the office.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             They're madmen! They're heading for 
                             the prison level. If you hurry, you 
                             might catch them.

                             Follow me! You stand guard.
    
                   The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to 
                   watch over the command office.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                                  (to Artoo)
                             Come on!
    
                   The guard aims a blaster at them.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Oh! All this excitement has overrun 
                             the circuits of my counterpart here. 
                             If you don't mind, I'd like to take 
                             him down to maintenance.

                             All right.
    
                   The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries 
                   out the door.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
    
                   As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  
                   Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his 
                   giant paws.
    
                   Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is 
                   snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

                   Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. 
                   Leia begins to sink into the trash.

                   Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall 
                   socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from 
                   the tiny robot.

                   The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against 
                   the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each 
                   other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds 
                   it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels 
                   the first crushing pressure against her body.

                   Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I 
                             turned it off!
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
    
                   Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his 
                   head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz 
                   and he rips it off his belt.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL
    
                   Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, 
                   but not distinctly.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Are you there, sir?

                             Shut down all garbage mashers on the

                             Shut down all the garbage mashers on

                             No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
    
                   Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible 
                   screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! 
                             Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast 
                             enough. It's all my fault! My poor

                   INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
    
                   The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. 
                   The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace 
                   in the background.
    
                                         LUKE
                             We're all right. You did great.
    
                   Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a 
                   number.
    
                                         LUKE

                   INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH
    
                   Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge 
                   tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. 
                   The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. 
                   The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading 
                   to a control panel that connects two large cables. He 
                   carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, 
                   and several lights on the board go from red to blue.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY
    
                   The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  
                   Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster 
                   belts.
    
                                         HAN
                             If we can just avoid any more female 
                             advice, we ought to be able to get 
                             out of here.
    
                   Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster 
                   from Solo.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Well, let's get moving!
    
                   Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage 
                   room, as he runs away and then stops howling.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (to Chewie)
                             Where are you going?
    
                   The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy 
                   tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a 
                   victim. Han aims his pistol.
    
                                         LEIA
                             No, wait. They'll hear!
    
                   Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes 
                   relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply 
                   shakes his head in disgust.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (to Chewie)
                             Come here, you big coward!
    
                   Chewie shakes his head "no."
    
                                         HAN
                             Chewie! Come here!
    
                                         LEIA
                             Listen. I don't know who you are, or 
                             where you came from, but from now 
                             on, you do as I tell you. Okay?
    
                   Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
    
                                         HAN
                             Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get 
                             one thing straight! I take orders 
                             from one person! Me!
    
                                         LEIA
                             It's a wonder you're still alive.
                                  (looking at Chewie)
                             Will somebody get this big walking 
                             carpet out of my way?
    
                   Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.
    
                                         HAN
                             No reward is worth this.
    
                   They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH
    
                   Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of 
                   stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly 
                   slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few 
                   feet of him.
    
                                         OFFICER
                             Secure this area until the alert is 
                             canceled.
    
                                         FIRST TROOPER
                             Give me regular reports.
    
                   All but two of the stormtroopers leave.
    
                                         FIRST TROOPER
                             Do you know what's going on?
    
                                         SECOND TROOPER
                             Maybe it's another drill.
    
                   Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers 
                   as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand 
                   toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the 
                   other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips 
                   past the troopers and into the main hallway.
    
                                         SECOND TROOPER
                             What was that?
    
                                         FIRST TROOPER
                             Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about 
                             it.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
    
                   Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and 
                   stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers 
                   are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (looking at his ship)
                             There she is.
    
                                         LUKE
                             See-Threepio, do you copy?
    
                                         THREEPIO
                                  (voice)
                             For the moment. Uh, we're in the 
                             main hangar across from the ship.
    
                                         LUKE
                             We're right above you. Stand by.
    
                   Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of 
                   the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and 
                   points out the window to the ship.
    
                                         LEIA
                             You came in that thing? You're braver 
                             that I thought.
    
                                         HAN
                             Nice! Come on!
    
                   Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the 
                   hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty 
                   Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are 
                   taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.
    
                                         FIRST TROOPER
                             It's them! Blast them!
    
                   Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges 
                   the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the 
                   stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down 
                   the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (to Luke and Leia)
                             Get back to the ship!
    
                                         LUKE
                             Where are you going? Come back!
    
                   Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
    
                                         LEIA
                             He certainly has courage.
    
                                         LUKE
                             What good will it do us if he gets 
                             himself killed? Come on!
    
                   Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for 
                   muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke 
                   and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
    
                   Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is 
                   yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a 
                   dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few 
                   feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops 
                   begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are 
                   moving into an attack position in front of the lone 
                   starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops 
                   begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
    
                   Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt 
                   to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of 
                   laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate 
                   extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of 
                   furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running 
                   the other way also.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
    
                   Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down 
                   a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They 
                   quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an 
                   open hatchway.

                   Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge 
                   that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. 
                   The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, 
                   and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance 
                   off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of 
                   his arm and pulls him back.
    
                                         LUKE
                                  (gasping)
                             I think we took a wrong turn.
    
                   Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby 
                   reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at 
                   the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch 
                   that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving 
                   them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  
                   Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.
    
                                         LEIA
                             There's no lock!
    
                   Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.
    
                                         LUKE
                             That oughta hold it for a while.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Quick, we've got to get across. Find 
                             the control that extends the bridge.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Oh, I think I just blasted it.
    
                   Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the 
                   stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making 
                   ominous drilling and pounding sounds.
    
                                         LEIA
                             They're coming through!
    
                   Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when 
                   laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol 
                   at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across 
                   the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops 
                   appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, 
                   and grabs at his chest.
    
                   Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by 
                   Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move 
                   back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Here, hold this.
    
                   Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. 
                   It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge 
                   overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the 
                   rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears 
                   and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  
                   Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet 
                   of more troops.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Here they come!
    
                   Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and 
                   he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the 
                   gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He 
                   tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the 
                   princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him 
                   quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.
    
                                         LEIA
                             For luck!
    
                   Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss 
                   to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as 
                   Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the 
                   stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at 
                   the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into 
                   the tiny subhallway.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY
    
                   Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several 
                   stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks 
                   to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the 
                   opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of 
                   the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY
    
                   Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the 
                   pirateship entry ramp.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Where could they be?
    
                   Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left 
                   and right, beeping a response.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR
    
                   Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several 
                   troopers hot on their trail.
    
                                         TROOPER
                             Close the blast doors!
    
                   At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in 
                   front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion 
                   race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage 
                   to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops 
                   before the doors slam shut.
    
                                         TROOPER
                             Open the blast doors! Open the blast 
                             doors!
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY
    
                   Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar 
                   where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, 
                   Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not 
                   ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his 
                   and steps slowly forward.
    
                                         VADER
                             I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. 
                             We meet again, at last. The circle 
                             is now complete.
    
                   Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive 
                   position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.
    
                                         VADER
                             When I left you, I was but the 
                             learner; now I am the master.
    
                                         BEN
                             Only a master of evil, Darth.
    
                   The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few 
                   moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right 
                   moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, 
                   as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He 
                   shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.
    
                   Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
                   by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke 
                   by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's 
                   blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark 
                   Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. 
                   The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments 
                   with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing 
                   sound.
    
                                         VADER
                             Your powers are weak, old man.
    
                                         BEN
                             You can't win, Darth. If you strike 
                             me down, I shall become more powerful 
                             than you can possibly imagine.
    
                   Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY
    
                   Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back 
                   against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the 
                   Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
    
                                         HAN
                             Didn't we just leave this party?
    
                   Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.
    
                                         HAN
                             What kept you?
    
                                         LEIA
                             We ran into some old friends.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Is the ship all right?
    
                                         HAN
                             Seems okay, if we can get to it. 
                             Just hope the old man got the tractor 
                             beam out of commission.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
    
                   Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they 
                   hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. 
                   Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord 
                   of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his 
                   group's vantage point.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Look!
    
                   Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader 
                   emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking 
                   bay.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY
    
                   Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's 
                   Imperial docking bay.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Come on, Artoo, we're going!
    
                   Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who 
                   were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards 
                   Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.
    
                   INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
    
                   Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The 
                   troops rush toward the battling knights.
    
                                         HAN
                             Now's our chance! Go!
    
                   They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops 
                   charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader 
                   takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings 
                   his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to 
                   deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.
    
                   The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts 
                   his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene 
                   look on his face.
    
                   Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's 
                   cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  
                   Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the 
                   empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers 
                   and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two 
                   and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.
    
                                         LUKE
                             No!
    
                   The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  
                   The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium 
                   Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns 
                   their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and 
                   advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (to Luke)
                             Come on!
    
                                         LEIA
                             Come on! Luke, its too late!
    
                                         HAN
                             Blast the door! Kid!
    
                   Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it 
                   explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge 
                   forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close 
                   behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the 
                   docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his 
                   onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, 
                   as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He 
                   fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.
    
                                         BEN'S VOICE
                             Run, Luke! Run!
    
                   Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns 
                   toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the 
                   troopers and races into the ship.
    
                   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
    
                   Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. 
                   The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the 
                   ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.
    
                                         HAN
                             I hope the old man got that tractor 
                             beam out if commission, or this is 
                             going to be a real short trip. Okay, 
                             hit it!
    
                   Chewbacca growls in agreement.
    
                   EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
    
                   The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking

                   Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off 
                   blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around 
                   him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She 
                   sits down beside him.

                   Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, 
                   as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

                   Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling 
                   into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large

                   Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo. 
                   The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in 
                   the room and then comes back on.

                   A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and 
                   fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as 
                   the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor 
                   hit, and bounces slightly.

                   The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the

                   A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The 
                   ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet 
                   fill of small computer chips.

                   An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, 
                   causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

                   swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser

                   pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon 
                   hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower 
                   of burning fragments.

                             explanation for the ease of our

                             Not this ship, sister.
    
                   Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

                             At least the information in Artoo is 
                             still intact.
    
                                         HAN
                             What's so important? What's he 
                             carrying?

                             It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't 
                             in this for your revolution, and I'm 
                             not in it for you, Princess. I expect 
                             to be well paid. I'm in it for the 
                             money!

                             that's what you'll receive!
    
                   She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, 
                   passes Luke coming in.

                             Your friend is quite a mercenary. I 
                             wonder if he really cares about 
                             anything... or anyone.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I care!
    
                   Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han 
                   stare out at the vast blackness of space.
    
                                         LUKE
                             So... what do you think of her, Han?
    
                                         HAN
                             I'm trying not to, kid!
    
                                         LUKE
                                  (under his breath)
                             Good...
    
                                         HAN
                             Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I 
                             don't know, what do you think? Do 
                             you think a princess and a guy like 
                             me...
    
                                         LUKE
                             No!
    
                   Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at 
                   young Luke's jealousy.

                   The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet 
                   Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

                   An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.  
                   He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely 
                   visible in the foliage.
    
                   EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE
    
                   Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple 
                   lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the 
                   fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the 
                   others are greeted by the Rebel troops.
    
                   Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored 
                   military speeder.
    
                   INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK
    
                   The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set 
                   up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the 
                   commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and 
                   gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.
    
                                         WILLARD
                                  (holding Leia)
                             You're safe! We had feared the worst.
    
                   Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.
    
                                         WILLARD
                             When we heard about Alderaan, we 
                             were afraid that you were... lost 
                             along with your father.

                             We don't have time for our sorrows, 
                             Commander. The battle station has 
                             surely tracked us here.
                                  (looking pointedly to 
                                  Han)
                             It's the only explanation for the 
                             ease of our escape. You must use the 
                             information in this R2 unit to plan

                   Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their 
                   discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer 
                   the call.
    
                                         TARKIN
                             Yes.

                   We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a 
                   moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

                   A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, 
                   surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of 
                   twisted green.
    
                   INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA
    
                   Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia 
                   and several other senators are to one side of the giant 
                   readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, 
                   navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is 
                   listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and 
                   Chewbacca are standing near the back.
    
                                         DODONNA
                             The battle station is heavily shielded 
                             and carries a firepower greater than 
                             half the star fleet. It's defenses 
                             are designed around a direct large-
                             scale assault. A small one-man fighter 
                             should be able to penetrate the outer 
                             defense.
    
                   Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands 
                   and addresses Dodonna.
    
                                         GOLD LEADER
                             Pardon me for asking, sir, but what 
                             good are snub fighters going to be 
                             against that?
    
                                         DODONNA
                             Well, the Empire doesn't consider a 
                             small one-man fighter to be any 
                             threat, or they'd have a tighter 
                             defense. An analysis of the plans 
                             provided by Princess Leia has 
                             demonstrated a weakness in the battle 
                             station.
    
                   Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping 
                   sounds, and turns his head from right to left.
    
                                         DODONNA
                             The approach will not be easy. You 
                             are required to maneuver straight 
                             down this trench and skim the surface 
                             to this point. The target area is 
                             only two meters wide. It's a small 
                             thermal exhaust port, right below 
                             the main port. The shaft leads 
                             directly to the reactor system. A 
                             precise hit will start a chain 
                             reaction which should destroy the 
                             station.
    
                   A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.
    
                                         DODONNA
                             Only a precise hit will set up a 
                             chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
                             shielded, so you'll have to use proton 
                             torpedoes.

                   Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship 
                   hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  
                   Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and 
                   unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this 
                   activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes 
                   onto an armored speeder.

                   Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter 
                   pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of 
                   his friend's departure.

                                         LUKE
                                  (getting angry)
                             Come on! Why don't you take a look 
                             around? You know what's about to 
                             happen, what they're up against. 
                             They could use a good pilot like 
                             you. You're turning your back on 
                             them.
    
                                         HAN
                             What good's a reward if you ain't 
                             around to use it? Besides, attacking 
                             that battle station ain't my idea of 
                             courage. It's more like suicide.
    
                                         LUKE
                             All right. Well, take care of 
                             yourself, Han. I guess that's what 
                             you're best at, isn't it?
    
                   Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.
    
                                         HAN
                             Hey, Luke... may the Force be with 
                             you!
    
                   Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in 
                   a small wave and then goes off.
    
                   Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,
    
                                         HAN
                             What're you lookin' at? I know what 
                             I'm doing.
    
                   INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP
    
                   Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.
    
                                         LEIA
                             What's wrong?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really 
                             thought he'd change his mind.
    
                                         LEIA
                             He's got to follow his own path. No 
                             one can choose it for him.
    
                                         LUKE
                             I only wish Ben were here.
    
                   Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke 
                   heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs 
                   his arm.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you 
                             get here... are you going out with 
                             us?!
    
                                         LUKE
                             Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there 
                             with you! Listen, have I got some 
                             stories to tell...
    
                   Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up 
                   behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born 
                   leader.
    
                                         RED LEADER
                             Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you 
                             been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
                             five?
    
                                         BIGGS
                             Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in 
                             the outer rim territories.
    
                   Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of 
                   his fighter.
    
                                         RED LEADER
                             I met your father once when I was 
                             just a boy, he was a great pilot. 
                             You'll do all right. If you've got 
                             half of your father's skill, you'll 
                             do better than all right.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Thank you, sir. I'll try.
    
                   Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
    
                                         BIGGS
                             I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll 
                             tell me your stories when we come 
                             back. All right?
    
                                         LUKE
                             I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
    
                                         BIGGS
                                  (going off)
                             You did, all right. It's going to be 
                             like old times, Luke. We're a couple 
                             of shooting stars that'll never be 
                             stopped!
    
                   Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for 
                   his ship.
    
                   As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly 
                   spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points 
                   to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the 
                   back of the fighter.
    
                                         CHIEF
                             This R2 unit of your seems a bit 
                             beat up. Do you want a new one?
    
                                         LUKE
                             Not on your life! That little droid 
                             and I have been through a lot 
                             together.
                                  (to Artoo)
                             You okay, Artoo?
    
                   The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of 
                   the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps 
                   that he is fine.
    
                   Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an 
                   his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive 
                   hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner 
                   into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo 
                   beeps good-bye.
    
                                         CHIEF
                             Okay, easy she goes!
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to 
                             come back.
    
                   Artoo beeps in agreement.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             You wouldn't want my life to get 
                             boring, would you?
    
                   Artoo whistles his reply.
    
                   All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  
                   The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the 
                   pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The 
                   hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted 
                   voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses 
                   are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit 
                   shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, 
                   holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace 
                   of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.
    
                                         BEN'S VOICE
                             Luke, the Force will be with you.
    
                   Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.
    
                   EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE
    
                   All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing 
                   on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The 
                   muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this 
                   eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion 
                   rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage 
                   in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud 
                   cover.
    
                   INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM
    
                   The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly 
                   before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its 
                   four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves 
                   ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear 
                   around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills 
                   the war room.

                   The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface 
                   of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying 
                   in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.
    
                   EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE
    
                   Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow 
                   around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in 
                   formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly 
                   pull away.
    
                   INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT
    
                   Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights, 
                   looking to each side at his wing men.

                   The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The 
                   Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in 
                   size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the 
                   metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna 
                   is built into the surface on one side.

                   As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome 
                   size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half 
                   of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area 
                   sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines 
                   and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a 
                   city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

                   Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming 
                   in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in 
                   the background. He moves his computer targeting device into 
                   position.

                   Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive 
                   towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across 
                   the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

                   Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
                   wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death

                   fires.

                   Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in

                   Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and

                   up to him.

                   Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their 
                   turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes 
                   about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head 
                   gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming 
                   noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet 
                   with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

                   A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the

                   fighter, who sticks close to his tail.

                   Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to 
                   normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

                   Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now 
                   followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of 
                   sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

                   In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the

                   background.

                   There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding 
                   in a mass of flames.

                   One of the engines explodes on Gold Five's Y-wing fighter, 
                   blazing out of control. He dives past the horizon toward the 
                   Death Star's surface, passing a TIE fighter during his

                   Darth Vader's well-aimed laserfire proves to be unavoidable, 
                   and strikes Red Ten's ship. Red Ten screams in anguish and 
                   pain.

                   Grimly, Red Leader takes careful aim and watches his computer 
                   targeting device, which shows the target lined up in the 
                   cross hairs, and fires.

                   An armed Imperial stormtrooper is knocked to the floor from 
                   the attack explosion. Other troopers scurrying about the 
                   corridors are knocked against the wall and lose their balance.

                             impacted on the surface.

                   Laserbolts are flung from Vader's TIE fighter, connecting 
                   with Red Leader's Rebel X-wing fighter. Red Leader buys it, 
                   creating a tremendous explosion far below. He screams and is 
                   destroyed.

                   intently to the talk between the pilots. The room is grim

                   EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
    
                   The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like 
                   Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small 
                   flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a 
                   supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.
    
                   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
    
                                         HAN
                             Great shot, kid. That was one in a 
                             million.
    
                   INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT
    
                   Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.
    
                                         BEN'S VOICE
                             Remember, the Force will be with 
                             you... always.
    
                   The ship rocks back and forth.
    
                   EXT. DARTH VADER'S TIE FIGHTER
    
                   Vader's ship spins off into space.
    
                   EXT. SPACE
    
                   The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.
    
                   INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR
    
                   Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a 
                   throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder 
                   as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. 
                   Princess Leia rushes toward him.
    
                                         LEIA
                             Luke! Luke! Luke!
    
                   She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance 
                   around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace 
                   one another, slapping each other on the back.
    
                                         HAN
                                  (laughing)
                             Hey! Hey!
    
                                         LUKE
                                  (laughing)
                             I knew you'd come back! I just knew 
                             it!
    
                                         HAN
                             Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all 
                             the credit and take all the reward.
    
                   Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves 
                   at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.
    
                                         LEIA
                                  (laughing)
                             Hey, I knew there was more to you 
                             than money.
    
                   Luke looks toward the ship.
    
                                         LUKE
                             Oh, no!
    
                   The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the 
                   fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say 
                             something!
                                  (to mechanic)
                             You can repair him, can't you?
    
                                         TECHNICIAN
                             We'll get to work on him right away.
    
                                         THREEPIO
                             You must repair him! Sir, if any of 
                             my circuits or gears will help, I'll 
                             gladly donate them.
    
                                         LUKE
                             He'll be all right.
    
                   INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM
    
                   Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
                   temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
                   are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
                   beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
                   march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
                   one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
                   Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
                   an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
                   whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
                   dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
                   dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
                   She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
                   winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
                   is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
                   troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
                   beeps with happiness.
    
                                                                      FADE OUT:
    
                   END CREDITS OVER STARS
    
                                             THE END
