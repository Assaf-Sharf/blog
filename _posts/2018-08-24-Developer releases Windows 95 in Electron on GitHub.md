<p>Computer users nostalgic for the 90s will be happy to hear that they can download and run a brand new port of a classic Microsoft operating system from GitHub.</p><p>Slack developer [Felix Rieseberg](http://www.felixrieseberg.com/) posted a port of Windows 95 running in https://alternativeto.net/software/electron/ on GitHub. It is compatible on machines running https://alternativeto.net/software/windows-10/, https://alternativeto.net/software/mac-os/, and https://alternativeto.net/software/linux-kernel/-based operating systems. </p><p>This Electron version of Windows 95 is possible due in large part to https://alternativeto.net/software/v86/, an open-source virtualization of of x86 CPUs made in JavaScript. Rieseberg states on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows95) that the release "only works well by accident and was mostly a joke," stating that the quality of the app's code is structured "accordingly."</p><p>According to [Tom Warren at The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17773180/microsoft-windows-95-app-download-features), apps such as the classic https://alternativeto.net/software/minesweeper/, https://alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-paint/, and https://alternativeto.net/software/wordpad/ all run properly within this Electron version of the classic operating system.</p><p>And yes, [it runs DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDXqmdFxofM).</p><p>Additional coverage:<br/>[Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/23/run-windows-95-app-mac-windows-linux/)<br/>[gHacks](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/08/24/you-can-now-install-windows-95-on-windows-linux-and-mac/)<br/>[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17773180/microsoft-windows-95-app-download-features)<br/></p>
