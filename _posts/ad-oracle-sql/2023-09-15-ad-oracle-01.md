# Relational Databases

Relational Database organizes data into relations or tables of related data. In a relational database, tables are made up of rows, which represent instances of a given entity, and columns, which represent attributes of each entity.

- Relation: A set of columns of related data

> Other types of database
>
> - Graph database: Neo4j
> - Object database: Realm, Objectivity/DB
> - Document database: CouchDB, MongoDB

## Column Data Types

- Number
- Text
- Date
- True/False value
- Binary data

# Keys and Unique Values

- Keys refer to only one specific row or record
  : - A table doesn't require a Primary Key, but having one helps to access specific records easily
  : - Synthetic or Surrogate Key is generated when a new record is inserted into a table automatically by a database that can be declared as the primary key of that table
  : - Composite Key - Two or more fields taken together to act as a unique identifier
  : - Foreign Key
- Unique values appear only once within a given column
