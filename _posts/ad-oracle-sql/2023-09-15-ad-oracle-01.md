# Relational Databases

Relational Database organizes data into relations or tables of related data. In a relational database, tables are made up of rows, which represent instances of a given entity, and columns, which represent attributes of each entity.

- Relation: A set of columns of related data

> Other types of database
>
> - Graph database: Neo4j
> - Object database: Realm, Objectivity/DB
> - Document database: CouchDB, MongoDB

## Column Data Types

- Number
- Text
- Date
- True/False value
- Binary data

<br>

# Keys and Unique Values

- Keys refer to only one specific row or record
  : - A table doesn't require a Primary Key, but having one helps to access specific records easily
  : - Synthetic or Surrogate Key is generated when a new record is inserted into a table automatically by a database that can be declared as the primary key of that table
  : - Composite Key - Two or more fields taken together to act as a unique identifier
  : - Foreign Key
- Unique values appear only once within a given column

<br>

# Relationships

- One to Many: One record in One table with Multiple records in Another table
- Many to Many: Multiple records in One table with Multiple records in Another table
- One to One: Only One record in One table with Only One record in Another table &rarr; The targeted record can't be associated with another record at the same time
  : This isn't too widely used, though it can be useful

<br>

# ACID and Transactions

ACID and Transactions

## Transaction

A transaction is a set of operations that must all be completed, and if any of the individual operations aren't completed, no changes are made to the database. &rarr; Anything that's partially done will be undone.

- Even though the word `transaction` often relates to financial activity, a transaction in a database doesn't have to deal with financial information
  : EX) Booking a reservation at a restaurant, Stock level in our inventory

1. Begin Transaction
2. Step 1
3. Step 2
4. Step 3
5. End Transaction

## ACID

Transactions follow a set of principles outlined by the ACID.

- Atomic: The transaction is indivisible, that pieces of it can't be separated out
- Consistency: Whatever the transaction does, it needs to leave the database in a valid or consistent state. The actions in a transaction can't violate integrity rules that are defined for the database
- Isolation: While the activities in the transaction are being completed, nothing else can make changes to the data involved
- Durability: The information we change in the transaction actually gets written to the database. When the transaction is reported as complete, the data is there.
