# Columns and Data Types

## Data Types

- Strings: Alphanumeric characters and text
  : - CHAR - Fixed number of characters
  : - VARCHAR - Variable number of characters up to a maximum length
  : - Other types for longer text

> CHAR & VARCHAR
>
> - CHAR: If the length of the string is less than set or fixed-length, then it is padded with extra memory space
> - VARCHAR: If the length of the string is less than the set or fixed-length, then it will store as it is without padded with extra memory spaces

> Storing Dates and Times
>
> March 9, 2023, 4:51PM

> - DATE &rarr; 2023-03-09
>   : EX) Birthday
> - DATETIME &rarr; 2023-03-09 16:51:00
>   : EX) Events, Reservations

# Numbers and Other Types

## Data Types for Numbers

> Null Value
>
> NULL represents the absence of a value &rarr; It's often used to represent a missing value in a database
>
> Null isn't a data type, it's more of a condition
>
> - If a cell has a value, it is NOT NULL &rarr; Even if a cell contains the text "null," it's not null
> - If there's a missing value, no value at all, not even 'false' or 'zero,' that value is null
>
> We can define whether a field can contain NULL values
