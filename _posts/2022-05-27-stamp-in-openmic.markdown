On Friday 27th May at 10:30 an open Mic session took place. The topic was \"Ontological Foundation of Hazards and Risk
in STAMP\". Recording and presentation is included.

In this presentation, we discuss the ontological foundations of the key safety engineering concepts - hazard and risk, as used by one of the newest safety models (STAMP). We propose a STAMP hazard risk ontology.

The text presentation is available at [this page](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/gsuiteintegration/index.html?state=%7B%22ids%22%3A%5B%221ZKqIy4CdVWQh6bD5MepahdqttsSB21Bm%22%5D%2C%22action%22%3A%22open%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22100616406588850202743%22%2C%22resourceKeys%22%3A%7B%7D%7D).
