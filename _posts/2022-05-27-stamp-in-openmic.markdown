On Friday 27th May at 10:30 an open Mic session took place. The topic was \"Ontological Foundation of Hazards and Risk
in STAMP\". Recording and presentation included.

{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId %}

In this
presentation, we discuss the ontological foundations of the key safety engineering concepts - hazard and risk, as used by one of
the newest safety models (STAMP). We propose a STAMP hazard risk ontology.
