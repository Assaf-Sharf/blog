<p><p>Epic Games, developers of games such as Fortnite and the popular Unreal Engine, has announced that, as of December 10th, 2018, the Infinity Blade trilogy of mobile games has been delisted from Apple's iOS App Store.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/infinityblade/en-US/news/infinity-blade-trilogy-says-goodbye" rel="nofollow">the announcement post by Epic concerning the delisting</a>, the company states that &quot;it has become increasingly difficult for our team to support the Infinity Blade series at a level that meets our standards.&quot; Because of this, Epic believes it is best to cease selling this trilogy of games and the in-app purchases within them.</p>
<p>Users that have already purchased the Infinity Blade trilogy can still download their contents as of the time of this writing. No device incompatibility has yet to be found, though this may very well change over time.</p>
