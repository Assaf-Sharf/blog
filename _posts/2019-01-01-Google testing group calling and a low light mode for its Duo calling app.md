<p><p>In the wake of Google Hangouts repurposing itself, other voice and video calling services by Google will now be picking up the slack. Case and point is Google Duo's current testing of group calling and low light mode implementation.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/31/first-look-google-duo-tests-group-calling-feature-and-low-light-mode/" rel="nofollow">staff at Android Police</a>, Duo, one of Google's multiple voice and video calling apps, is testing group calling and low light features in the Android version of the app.</p>
<p>Group video calling is an important feature for communication apps to have implemented at this point. Between WhatsApp supporting 4 people simultaneously and FaceTime supporting 32 people, this year has seen some of the world's most popular chat apps implement support for group video calls. Google Duo will be closer to WhatsApp in its cap, with up to 7 simultaneous participants in group calls.</p>
<p>The low light mode will adjust the settings of the front facing camera of your device to allow users talking in a place with little-to-no lighting to be seen by other conversation participants.</p>
<p>No release date has been announced for the public implementation of these features.</p>
