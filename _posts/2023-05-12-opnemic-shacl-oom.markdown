##### The abstract

Semantic Web ontologies can be used as a base for application object models - they provide several benefits, including
global identifiers, clearly described relationships, and the ability to infer new knowledge. However, their reliance
on the open world assumption is problematic in the information system setting, where it is assumed that what is not stated
is not true.

SHACL is a W3C standard allowing to define and validate integrity constraints over RDF graphs. This presentation shows
how SHACL constraints can be used to define an object-ontological mapping, thus allowing the use of an ontology in an
information system with closed world semantics.
