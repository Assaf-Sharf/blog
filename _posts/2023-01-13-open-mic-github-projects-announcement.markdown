##### The abstract

IT project management is a complex process that involves coordinating the efforts of multiple people, often working remotely and across different departments, to achieve a common goal. It requires the ability to track progress, identify and resolve issues, and keep everyone informed about the project's status. Additionally, developer teams need to be able to plan and organize work effectively, to ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget.

[Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects), among other project management tools, provide developer teams with the tools they need to organize and manage the various tasks and issues that arise during the course of a project. By creating project board and tables, team members can easily see what needs to be done, who is responsible for it, and when it is due. This helps to keep everyone on the same page, and ensures that tasks are completed in a timely manner. The ability to integrate with other Github tools such as pull requests, enable the team to track the progress of the project and resolve issues more efficiently.

Additionally, Github Projects enable project managers to easily keep track of multiple projects, thus it's ideal for teams that are managing multiple projects at once. With its support for agile methodologies, it help the team to organize and prioritize work, resulting in better efficiency and productivity.

This weeks open mic presents different solutions to help developer teams to keep track of their projects.
