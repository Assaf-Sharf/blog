<!-- NordIQuEst participated in the QC Norway event last month, discussing the future of #quantum computing in Norway. -->

In a live demonstration conducted by Axel Andersson, the eX3 experimental infrastructure for exploration of exascale computing at Simula Research Laboratory located in Norway was connected to the Chalmers University of Technology QAL 9000 quantum computer in Sweden.

This was already the second successful cross-border HPC+QC integration within the project, and a prime example of the importance of collaboration between different stakeholders, nations, and domain experts for getting quantum computing out to the end-users.

[Recordings of the event are available and well worth a watch](https://www.qcnorway.no/videos). A wide variety of view-points from academia to industry were featured, which made for inspiring discussions! A special mention for GÃ¶ran Wendin's presentation on NordIQuEst is of course in place!
