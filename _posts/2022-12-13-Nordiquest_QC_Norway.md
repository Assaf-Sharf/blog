# Axel Andersson on eX3 + QAL9000 connection

In a live demonstration conducted by Axel Andersson, the eX3 experimental infrastructure for exploration of exascale computing at Simula Research Laboratory located in Norway was connected to the Chalmers University of Technology QAL 9000 quantum computer in Sweden.

This was already the second successful cross-border HPC+QC integration within the project, and a prime example of the importance of collaboration between different stakeholders, nations, and domain experts for getting quantum computing out to the end-users.
