###### The abstract:

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in smart data-driven safety management systems compared to the traditional ones. The demand for such an upgrade comes from the frequent changes in our daily life and technological innovation which introduce new causes and factors of accidents, but also from the ever more advanced safety solutions that attempt to match the complexity of our world today. The increasing amount and heterogeneity of safety-related data introduces new demands for proper knowledge management to enable detection of safety-related problems and predicting them. In this paper, we discuss the ontological foundations of the key safety engineering concepts - hazard and risk, as used by one of the newest safety models - the System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP). We consider their representation in safety systems, specifically in the domain of aviation safety. As a result, we propose a STAMP hazard risk ontology that could help in analyzing accidents and modeling control issues according to STAMP. For evaluation, we tested our ontology on examples from aviation practice.
