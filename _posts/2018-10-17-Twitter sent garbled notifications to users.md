<p><p>People with the Twitter app on their phones may have unlocked them to some strange letters and numbers displayed as notifications.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Twitter users set to receive notifications from the social network were treated to a series of notification bubbles containing garbled spam-like messages. This happened with enough frequency that even Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1052238298402287617" rel="nofollow">posted a message</a> saying that the developers at Twitter were &quot;on it.&quot;</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, the official Twitter Support account <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1052260374806851584" rel="nofollow">posted details</a> about what the messages actually were. The &quot;red bubbles&quot; users see when they have unread notifications from Twitter on their devices were being sent as notification bubbles in code.</p>
<p>Outside of being abnormal and a statement that the issue has been resolved, there is no evidence of any hacking or personal data access.</p>
