Jekyll is a simple static site generator for personal, project, or organisation sites. We have used it in the past for the [KBSS web site](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/) or [termit documentation](https://kbss-cvut.github.io/termit-web/). This Ruby based site generator by Tom Peterson-Werner allows easy support for themes and plugins, especially using [Bundler](https://bundler.io) by simply adding them to the Gemfile and rebuilding bundle.

```gem "jekyll-rdf", "~> 3.2"```

```bundle update```

Jekyll RDF is a plugin for Jekyll to support rendering RDF data based on the given templates. Resource description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data interchange, using graphs instead of tables. Rendering RDF data into the web pages is the basis of the semantic web approach as defined by Tim Berners-Lee.

Jekyll RDF allows users to render data with multiple layouts for different classes or instances or access data directly from the triple store using SPARQL endpoint.

Presentation contains installation and basic configuration of the plugin and live demo with minimal running example.
