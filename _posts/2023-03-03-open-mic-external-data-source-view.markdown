##### The abstract

Data integration is one of the common problems occurring in modern distributed applications. Data integration is a problem where data needs to be integrated across multiple applications with their own data storage that may have different schemas.

In this session Bogdan Kostov presented a data integration scenario where a data source needs to be updated from the another data source view. Speaker comes with a potential solution of the problem and discuss it in the presentation itself and then also in the Q&A section afterwords, clarifying some of the concepts.
