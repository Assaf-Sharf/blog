<p><p>Users of Plex that used its cloud-based service in order to avoid utilizing an always-on PC or network attached storage unit will soon need to utilize alternatives. On November 30th, 2018, Plex Cloud will no longer be available for existing users.</p>
<p>According to Plex's official <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/226825168-faq-plex-cloud/" rel="nofollow">frequently asked questions page</a> for its Plex Cloud service, this discontinuation is due to being unable to &quot;...[deliver] a truly first class Plex experience to <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/plex-cloud/'><img alt='Small Plex Cloud icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/plex-cloud_98423.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Plex Cloud</a> users at a reasonable cost.&quot;</p>
