```python
# Python3 program to add two numbers

number1 = input("First number: ")
number2 = input("\nSecond number: ")

# Adding two numbers
# User might also enter float numbers
sum = float(number1) + float(number2)

# Display the sum
# will print value in float
print("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(number1,
											number2, sum))
```

#이러면 되는겁니까?

씻고 오면 올라가 있겠죠?
