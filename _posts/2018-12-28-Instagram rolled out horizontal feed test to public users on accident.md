<p><p>Many Instagram users were surprised today when their Explore feeds were scrolling in a new horizontal layout instead of vertically without any prior warning. As it turns out, this was not intentional.</p>
<p>A test of a new layout, which utilized a lot of the design language of Instagram's relatively recent Stories feature, was only meant to be just that: A test that wasn't for any sort of public distribution. However, somewhere along the line, this test was rolled out to  several users.</p>
<p>The head of Instagram <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1078321786586951680" rel="nofollow">posted</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1078322176070021121" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> earlier today about the occurrence, asking any users still experiencing the experimental layout to restart the app in order to get their feeds back to normal.</p>
<p>As of now, no formal announcement has been made about plans concerning the formal rollout of the new Explore feed layout by <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/instagram/'><img alt='Small Instagram icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/instagram_112969.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Instagram</a> or its staff.</p>
