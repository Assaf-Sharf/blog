During the semester we ran two subjects -- Enterprise architecture (EAR) and Ontology and Semantic Web (OSW).

### Enterprise architecture

### Ontologies and Semantic web

Ontologies and Semantic Web is a masters degree subject focused on bringing meaning to the data and its processing in this way. The course guides students through current trends and technologies in the semantic web field.

In the winter semester 2022/23 the teachers assigned to the course were [Petr Křemen](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#petr-křemen) and [Michal Med](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#michal-med). During the whole semester, students got the theoretical basis in the semantics and ontologies and in the tutorials they were practicing new knowledge on the real data. During the course, students processed semestral work with three checkpoints, in which students proved the understanding of semantics and ontologies and ability to process the data in this way.

In he last years term (winter 2021/22) the course took huge variation due to the deprecated lessons and bad feedback from students. Since the change, score of the student survey rapidly increased and the trend continues in this semester, too. Feedback given by students from the last semester was already worked in.

From the feedback given this year, some more changes must take place, primarily better description of semestral work including all checkpoints and samples on how individual checkpoint outputs should look like.

From the total count of 14 students, 10 students have passed the exam, which is similar to the last years success rate. The overall rating in the survey is also similar to the last year.
