- cilium
- kubectl
- helm

## Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is particularly well-suited for monitoring dynamic, cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes. Here's an overview of Prometheus and how it facilitates monitoring in a Kubernetes environment:

### Prometheus Overview

1. **Data Model**:
  - Prometheus follows a multi-dimensional data model, where time-series data is identified by metric names and key-value pairs called labels.
Metrics represent numerical values that can be observed and monitored over time.
2. **Data Retrieval**:
  - Prometheus uses a pull-based approach to collect metrics from monitored targets.
Each target (e.g., a Kubernetes node or container) exposes an HTTP endpoint where Prometheus can fetch metrics.
3. **Scalability**:
  - Prometheus is designed to be highly scalable, making it suitable for large-scale distributed systems like Kubernetes.
It can handle a high volume of metrics from numerous targets.
3. **Query Language**:
  - Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) allows users to express complex queries to analyze and aggregate collected metrics.
PromQL facilitates the creation of custom dashboards and alerts.
Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus:
4. **Exporter Components**:
  - Kubernetes exposes a rich set of metrics through its API server, kubelet, and other components.
Prometheus exporters are used to convert these metrics into a format that Prometheus can scrape.
5. **Service Discovery**:
  - Prometheus uses service discovery mechanisms to automatically discover and monitor new instances of services as they are deployed in Kubernetes.
Kubernetes Service Discovery and DNS-based service discovery are commonly used.
6. **Instrumentation**:
  - Kubernetes components are instrumented to expose metrics in a format that Prometheus understands.
Prometheus also supports custom instrumentation, allowing users to expose application-specific metrics.
7. **Alerting and Monitoring**:
  - Prometheus provides a built-in alerting system that allows users to define alerting rules based on metric conditions.
Grafana is often used in conjunction with Prometheus to create dashboards for visualizing metrics.
8. **Integration with Kubernetes Ecosystem**:
  - Prometheus is a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) project and is well-integrated with the Kubernetes ecosystem.
It works seamlessly with other tools like Grafana, Alertmanager, and Kubernetes itself.

In summary, Prometheus is a powerful monitoring solution for Kubernetes, offering a flexible and scalable approach to collecting, querying, and alerting based on the metrics generated by the Kubernetes ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and performance of applications deployed in Kubernetes clusters.

### Prometheus Installation

The Prometheus stack includes a few components that greatly help SREs/administrators monitor/observe deployed Kubernetes resources. These include:

* The [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)
* Highly available [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
* Highly available [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager)
* [Prometheus node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
* [Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter)
* [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

Installing the Prometheus stack on Kubernetes using Helm is a common and convenient approach. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. Here's a step-by-step guide for Kubernetes administrators on installing the Prometheus stack using Helm:

1. Add Prometheus Helm Repository:

   - Add the Prometheus Helm repository to your Helm client.
  
```yaml
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

2. Create Namespace (Optional):

   * Create a dedicated namespace for Prometheus if desired.

```yaml
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

3. Install Prometheus Operator:

   * Install the Prometheus Operator using Helm.

```yaml
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring --create-namespace
```

4. Verify Installation:

   * Check the status of the deployed resources.

```yaml
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

5. Access Prometheus Dashboard:

   * Prometheus comes with a web-based dashboard. Expose it for access.

```yaml
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-stack-kube-prom-prometheus 9090
```

   > Access the Prometheus dashboard at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) in your web browser.

6. Access Grafana Dashboard (Optional):

   * Grafana is included in the Prometheus stack. Expose it for access.

```yaml
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-stack-grafana 3000:80
```

   > Access the Grafana dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and log in (default credentials are admin/prom-operator).

7. Configure Data Source in Grafana (Optional):

   * Configure Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
     * URL: http://prometheus-stack-kube-prom-prometheus:9090
     * Save the configuration.

8. Explore and Customize:

   * Explore the Prometheus dashboard and Grafana to monitor your Kubernetes cluster.
   * Customize Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerting rules as needed.

By following these steps, Kubernetes administrators can easily set up and start using the Prometheus stack for monitoring their Kubernetes clusters. The Helm charts provided by the Prometheus community simplify the installation process and allow for customization based on specific monitoring requirements. Take note of the namespace where you install the prometheus-stack to as we will need to specify that when we upgrade Cilium. Stay tuned when I cover configuring alerts in Prometheus and integration with Alertmanager!

## Cilium

Please refer to my previous post to find more information on what Cilium offers.

### Cilium Upgrade

In order to integrate our previously installed Cilium/Hubble we need to update a few of our Helm values, particularly that involving ServiceMonitors. Update the file containing the values (detailed [here](https://mitchmurphy.io/cilium-rke2/#install-cilium)) to:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: smig-cluster1
  id: 11
prometheus:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: false
dashboards:
  enabled: true
hubble:
  metrics:
    enabled:
    - dns:query;ignoreAAAA
    - drop
    - tcp
    - flow
    - icmp
    - http
    dashboards:
      enabled: true
    serviceMonitor:
      enabled: true
      namespace: default
      labels:
        release: prometheus-stack
  relay:
    enabled: true
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
      serviceMonitor:
        enabled: true
        namespace: default
        labels:
          release: prometheus-stack
  ui:
    enabled: true
    baseUrl: "/"
version: 1.14.3
operator:
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    serviceMonitor:
      enabled: true
      namespace: default
      labels:
        release: prometheus-stack
  dashboards:
    enabled: true
envoy:
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    serviceMonitor:
      enabled: true
      namespace: default
      labels:
        release: prometheus-stack
clustermesh:
  apiserver:
    metrics:
      enabled: false
      serviceMonitor:
        enabled: true
        namespace: default
        labels:
          release: prometheus-stack
```

Take note of the label that is added to each ServiceMonitor, this must be present in order for Prometheus to detect the "target" and start scraping it. Now let's upgrade Cilium:

```yaml
cilium upgrade -f cilium.yaml
```

### Cilium ServiceMonitor Verification

n order to verify that Prometheus is picking up these new targets, you need to port-forward and make sure that they show up under Status -> Targets. 

### Cilium Grafana Dashboards

Because we specified in our values file that we wish to create Grafana dashboards, these get created as ConfigMaps and automatically picked up by Grafana. Until we expose Grafana as an Ingress, we must port-forward to it:

```yaml
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-stack-grafana 8080:80 &
```

Now visit our [dashboards](http://localhost:8080/dashboards), and click on the Hubble dashboard. Because we have not deployed anything to our cluster we should not see much here, but as you can see Cilium/Hubble provides quite advanced metrics! We will visit this dashboard again after we deploy a few things and test our system!
