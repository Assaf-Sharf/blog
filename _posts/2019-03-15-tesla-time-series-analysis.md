title: "Time Series Analysis: Tesla Stock"
date: 2019-03-15
excerpt: "While American automakers went bankrupt, Tesla became just the first successful automobile start-up in the United States in over 110 years. Here I take a deeper look into Tesla's stock price (since it's creation), specifically: autocorrelation (both closing prices and returns), ARIMA and SARIMA models for forecasting and the use of Facebook's open source Prophet framework for detecting trends. "
