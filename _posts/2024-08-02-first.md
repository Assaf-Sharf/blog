  Hello! I am Min!
  I am currently interested in AI, Security, and Mobile Web & App Development.
  I know that's a lot, but my goal as a freshman is to experience various fields of computer science.
  I decided to start with Web development.
  Since I am learning by myself with online courses, I might have various problems on my codes.
  Now, I will make some notes of what I learned today!
