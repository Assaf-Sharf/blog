<p><p>Apple has released its iOS 12.1.4 update, re-enabling support for Group FaceTime after fixing a major exploit.</p>
<p><a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2019/1/apple-disables-group-facetime-until-major-bug-is-fixed/" rel="nofollow">Last Monday, Apple announced</a> that it had disabled Group FaceTime calls in order to fix a recently discovered exploit that allowed users to listen to audio broadcasted from another person's device before they answered a FaceTime call. According to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209520" rel="nofollow">the Apple Support page detailing the update</a>, this exploit was a &quot;logic issue&quot; that has been resolved by implementing &quot;improved state management.&quot;</p>
<p>With this update, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/facetime/'><img alt='Small FaceTime icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/facetime_100725.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />FaceTime</a> calls with up to 32 participants are now once again safe and viable, with that 32-person limit surpassing the 25-person limit of Google's <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-hangouts/'><img alt='Small Hangouts icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-hangouts_83729.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Hangouts</a> and far surpassing the 4-person limit of Facebook's <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/whatsapp/'><img alt='Small WhatsApp Messenger icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/whatsapp_58669.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />WhatsApp Messenger</a>. This is provided, of course, that you and all possible participants have a compatible iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.</p>
