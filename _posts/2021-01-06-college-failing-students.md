# Where College Fails Students
Many graduates might find that they are having a hard time landing their first job. You might be answering the coding questions with the correct answer, and you have the right attitude. But you’re still not landing the job. In reality, although college gives students a base layer of knowledge, the core curriculums is lacking education in popular technology.

As those who have spent several years in the industry know, technology constantly changes and improves. To follow best practices and be as efficient as possible, learning and integrating this new technology is crucial. Unfortunately, new technology arises too fast for college curriculums to keep up with. Therefore many college grads do not have a deep understanding in these core technologies, fundamentals, and best practices that industries are moving towards. For this reason, candidates are being passed for other candidates who possess this knowledge.

## How I Learned
As someone who didn’t learn technology in school, instead learned it on their own, and on the job, I have a unique perspective. I have learned that college graduates tend to all know similar things and lack knowledge in core aspects. By learning on my own, I was able to learn those core aspects that my peers were missing and able to propel my career. On the job, I worked with other engineers who provided me with further resources on how to improve and accelerate my growth as an engineer.

Therefore, to increase your chances of landing the right job, you need to learn these industry best practices. As someone who has worked with many of these technologies which are being integrated with some of the most advanced companies, I can provide guidance to other engineers on what they can learn to improve their chances at landing their dream job. You not only need to know what everyone else knows, you need to learn what everyone else doesn’t.
