<p><p>Short-form social network Twitter will be publicly testing new features and layouts for public conversation threads in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Twitter conveyed this information via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/08/twitter-conversational-features-beta-program/" rel="nofollow">an interview with Engadget</a> at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Users can apply to participate in public beta testing of these new features and layouts and leave feedback. Thousands of users will be accepted into these testing runs.</p>
<p>Unlike Twitter's <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-beta-experiments-program" rel="nofollow">Experiments Program</a>, the conversation thread tests will not be under any nondisclosure agreement, and users will be able to share their experiences and screenshots publicly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We're making some pretty big changes to the way conversations look and feel on Twitter, and we don't want to just unveil that one day and what if you don't like it or it's not working for you? We really want to bring our community along for this journey and be a part of this. We want to this kind of thing more often.</p>
