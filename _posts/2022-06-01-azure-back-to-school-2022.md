## **2022 Call for Speakers/Presenters**

Azure Back to School is back again this year.  Last year, we had enough participants to have 1-2 presentations daily for all 30 days of September.  I'd like to have twice this many this year.  Submit your sessions between 1 April 2022 and 1 June 2022.  Sessions can be videos or blog articles.  Sessions should have something actionable that the viewers can learn and execute on their own.  

Submit your session here: <https://sessionize.com/azback2school2022/>


Schedule Coming Soon!!!
