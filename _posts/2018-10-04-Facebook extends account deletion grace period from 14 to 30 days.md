<p><p>Facebook is giving users a bigger window of time to think about coming back after leaving.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/9/a-new-facebook-hack-has-exposed-data-for-50-million-users" rel="nofollow">last week's hack</a>, Facebook has decided to increase the period in which users can decide to &quot;undo&quot; the deletion of their accounts on the site.</p>
<p>According the a Facebook spokesperson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933264/facebook-account-deletion-grace-period-extension-30-days" rel="nofollow">speaking to The Verge</a>, this extension of the grace period that users can recover their account from deletion is in order to &quot;...[give] people more time to make a fully informed choice.&quot;</p>
