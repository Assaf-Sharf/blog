Github is a well known Git solution between all developers around the world. It helps you to manage your Git repositories remotely and offers extra features to complement the Git core and make you more productive. These extra features are for example Issues, Pull Requests, Labels, Milestones, Releases... We know about about them becase we use Github daily but we're totally conscious of how productive we can be using these components properly.

## Github + External Project Management Tool = Synchronization
I've been working during the past months in a project management tool as a developer. We used Github and tried to translate tasks from that platform to Github in order to work in them. Although we used milestones, and other internal methods to connect these developers items with the platform, all the management core was contained in that platform. This is something good but if you ensure that the synchronization between these two components is taken into account by all the team. Synchronization is something difficult to mantain, sometimes you feel a sync man! and you are focused on having a healthy communication between Github and your project management platform (PMP), but some others you feel so tired that you forget to report the status of your Github items to your PMP. When it happens the communication is broken and it implies extra work for your workmates like *where did you work on this?, why didn't you resolve the task?, why didn't you apply the proper label?* In these situations you feel like you are doing repeated stuff that you could do just once. Sometimes you make use of scrips that you develop on your own but if you can't spend a lot of time **developing scripts** for each communication flow.

## Github, but what if I'm not a developer?
Although it sounds strange Github is not only for developers. The entire Git concept can be applied to design, to the company related stuff, ... Once all the team members know about the flow it's pretty easy to stay connected an synchronized. Think about something like [**Markdown**](http://whatismarkdown.com/). Talking from the developer side we use a lot when we start a new repo and we have to fill the README.md file (*I remember the first time I knew about it when I created my first repo*). Markdown is becoming popular, it's used now in blogging platforms (*I'm in fact writting this article using markdown*). We could use Mardown in **our website/landing page repository** I've seen companies that took the decision to stick to Markdown instead of choosing over-loaded editors like the one Wordpress offers to you.
