<p><p>Online shopping giant Amazon emailed certain customers on Tuesday, November 20th that it says were subjected to a &quot;technical error&quot; that temporarily exposed their usernames and email addresses. Beyond that, information was quite sparse.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/21/amazon-admits-it-exposed-customer-email-addresses-doubles-down-on-secrecy/" rel="nofollow">Zack Whittaker and Josh Constine at TechCrunch</a>, an Amazon spokesperson simply stated the fact that usernames and email addresses were exposed, only adding that the company &quot;...[has] fixed the issue and informed customers who may have been impacted.” The amount of shoppers impacted by this information leak has not been disclosed, with the spokesperson adding that they have “nothing to add beyond our statement.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re contacting you to let you know that our website inadvertently disclosed your email address due to a technical error. The issue has been fixed. This is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action.</p>
