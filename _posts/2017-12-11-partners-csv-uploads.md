Convictional allows you to upload partners from a CSV file. In order for partners to upload successfully, we need the CSV in the following format:

code,shop name,email,status,price list name,invited status

ie. 12345,My Trading Partner,partner@domain.com,true,My Price List,false

* Code is a unique code for this customer
* Shop name is the shop name from their myshopify.com URL (ie. shop.myshopify.com, just enter "shop")
* Email is the email to invite to trade with you
* Status is true if you want to sync, false if not
* Price list name is the name of the price list they are assigned
* Invited status is true if they have been invited, false if not

Do not include any headers in the file, just the data formatted as described. 

If you need help importing a list of connected shops, email [support@convictional.com](mailto:support@convictional.com)
