<p><p>Popular crowdsourced question and answer site Quora was breached, with up to 100 million users having their data compromised.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://blog.quora.com/Quora-Security-Update" rel="nofollow">an official blog post about the breach</a> by Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, the information potentially compromised includes:<br />
• Account information, e.g. name, email address, encrypted (hashed) password, data imported from linked networks when authorized by users<br />
• Public content and actions, e.g. questions, answers, comments, upvotes<br />
• Non-public content and actions, e.g. answer requests, downvotes, direct messages (note that a low percentage of Quora users have sent or received such messages)</p>
<p>The investigation into this breach is still ongoing, so more detailed information may still be uncovered. Users that have been impacted by this breach are being advised to check the email address that was used to register for Quora, as they will be notified of how they've been impacted via email. In addition, all users have been logged out of the site, and additional security enhancements will be made as the investigation of this breach progresses.</p>
<p>A continuously updated support article about this breach is available on <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020212652" rel="nofollow">Quora's Help Center</a>.</p>
