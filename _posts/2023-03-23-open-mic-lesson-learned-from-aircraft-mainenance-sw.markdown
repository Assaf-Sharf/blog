##### The abstract

Within project [Improving effectiveness of aircraft maintenance planning and execution](https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/project/CK01000204)
KBSS developed an information system that enables interactive creation of aircraft maintenance plans and a dashboard application
that assesses the progress of ongoing plan executions.
The presentation shares the insights we acquired through processing and interpreting input data from the maintenance organization.
It also addresses the challenges we encountered when computing the actual state of the system that provided us with input data
in the form of partial snapshots.
