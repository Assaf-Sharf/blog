<p><p>Users of Evolve, a virtualized LAN client that allows users to play games with local multiplayer over the Internet, will be using a new service soon. Evolve is being discontinued and merging into a rival virtual LAN client and social network created by the developers of XSplit and Challonge.</p>
<p>As announced on <a href="https://www.evolvehq.com/welcome" rel="nofollow">Evolve's website</a>, the service is &quot;merging&quot; with <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/player-me/'><img alt='Small Player.me icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/player-me_73889.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Player.me</a>, with the official shutdown date for Evolve landing on December 13, 2018. This announcement comes over a year after Evolve had been saved by an until-now unknown partner. The time since then has been focused on implementing a way to transfer Evolve's userbase over to Player.me.</p>
<p>As <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/evolve/'><img alt='Small Evolve icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/evolve_14899.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Evolve</a> will be merged in to Player.me, many users will end up migrating to the latter service (with <a href="https://evolve.player.me/" rel="nofollow">a website set up</a> for Evolve users to migrate their accounts to Player.me). There is also a dedicated <a href="https://helpdesk.player.me/en/category/evolve-s6fvq0/" rel="nofollow">Evolve FAQ available on Player.me's support site</a>. Features of Evolve such as messaging, recording, and streaming will still be available.</p>
