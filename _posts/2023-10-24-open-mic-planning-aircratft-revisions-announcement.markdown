The Open mic session starts on Friday 3rd November 2023 at 9:30 at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). Speaker [Bogdan Kostov](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#bogdan-kostov) introduces the topic of Planning Aircraft Revisions Based on Work Session Records.


##### The abstract

Aircraft revisions are complex projects that could contain hundreds of non trivial tasks. These are some of the reasons why planning of aircraft revisions is not an easy task and it might lead to inadequate deadline predictions. This presentation will be on the topic of automated planning of aircraft revisions based on historical work session records. This includes describing the analysis of the input data, i.e. the work session records, the current algorithm to schedule tasks automatically and validation of created schedules. Finally he will discuss future work on how to try to improve the existing automated planning algorithm.
