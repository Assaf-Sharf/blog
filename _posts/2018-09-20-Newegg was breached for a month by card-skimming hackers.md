<p><p>The electronics focused online storefront Newegg is currently in the spotlight for having suffered an attack from the same hackers that hit British Airways and TicketMaster UK. These hackers, according to Sean Gallagher at Ars Technica, &quot;managed to inject 15 lines of JavaScript into Newegg's webstore checkout that forwarded credit card and other data to a server with a domain name that made it look like part of Newegg's Web infrastructure. It appears that all Web transactions over the past month were affected by the breach.&quot;</p>
<p>This malicious code was present in every Newegg checkout from August 14th to September 18th. According to an email written by Newegg CEO Danny Lee and sent to customers, an FAQ will be published by Friday, September 21st to address common concerns.</p>
<p>As of the publishing of this article, it is unknown how many credit cards used for purchases on Newegg between August 14th and September 18th were impacted.</p>
