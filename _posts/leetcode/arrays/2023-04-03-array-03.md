# Problem

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/521/introduction/3240/)

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
- Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
- Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:

- Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
- Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

# Solution

[Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/editorial/)

## Approach 1: Sort

Algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty result array to store the squared numbers in non-decreasing order.
2. Loop through each number in the input array:
   : a. Calculate the square of the current number.
   : b. Add the squared number to the result array.
3. Sort the result array in non-decreasing order.
4. Return the sorted result array.

```
class Solution:
    def sorted_squares(self, nums):
        result = []
        for num in nums:
            result.append(num * num)
        result.sort()
        return result

solution = Solution()
print(solution.sorted_squares([-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]))
```

Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(N log‚Å°N), where N is the length of A.
- Space complexity : O(N) or O(log‚Å°N)

## Approach 2: Two Pointer

Algorithm:

1. Initialize three variables: n, result, and two pointers left and right.
2. n is assigned the length of the input array nums, result is assigned a list of n zeros, and left is set to 0 and right to n-1.
3. Iterate over the array nums in reverse order (from n-1 to 0) using the for loop and the index variable i.
4. Check if the absolute value of the left pointer element of nums is less than the absolute value of the right pointer element of nums.
5. If the absolute value of the left pointer element of nums is less than the absolute value of the right pointer element of nums, then the square of the right pointer element is appended to the result list and the right pointer is decremented by 1.
6. Otherwise, the square of the left pointer element of nums is appended to the result list and the left pointer is incremented by 1.
7. Finally, the function returns the result list.

```
class Solution:
    def sorted_squares(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        result = [0] * n
        left = 0
        right = n - 1

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if abs(nums[left]) < abs(nums[right]):
                square = nums[right]
                right -= 1
            else:
                square = nums[left]
                left += 1
            result[i] = square * square
        return result

solution = Solution()
print(solution.sorted_squares([-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]))
```

Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of A.
- Space complexity : O(N) if you take output into account and O(1) otherwise.

# For better understanding

## 1. Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", result));

"Console.WriteLine()" is a method used in C# to print output to the console. "string.Join()" is a method that concatenates a specified separator string between each element of an array and returns the concatenated string.

In this case, "string.Join(", ", result)" takes the result array and concatenates each element with a comma and space separator (", ") in between. This creates a single string that can be printed to the console using "Console.WriteLine()".

So "Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", result))" prints each element of the result array to the console, separated by a comma and space.

<br>

## 2. Array.Sort(result);

"Array.Sort(result);" is a method in C# that sorts the elements of an array in ascending order. In this particular context, it sorts the elements in the "result" array in ascending order after they have been squared and added to the "result" array.

The "Array.Sort" method uses the quicksort algorithm, which has an average time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the array being sorted. In the worst case, quicksort has a time complexity of O(n^2), but this is rare and unlikely to occur in practice.

<br>

## 3. Math.Abs(nums[left]) < Math.Abs(nums[right])

"Math.Abs()" is a built-in method in C# that returns the absolute value of a number. The "Math.Abs()" method is used to get the absolute values of "nums[left]" and "nums[right]" to compare their magnitudes without considering their signs.
