# Problem

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/521/introduction/3238/)

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:

- Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
- Output: 2

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Hint #1:

You need to think about two things as far as any window is concerned. One is the starting point for the window. How do you detect that a new window of 1s has started? The next part is detecting the ending point for this window. How do you detect the ending point for an existing window? If you figure these two things out, you will be able to detect the windows of consecutive ones. All that remains afterward is to find the longest such window and return the size.

# Solution

[Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/editorial/)

Algorithm:

1. Maintain a counter for the number of 1's.
2. Increment the counter by 1, whenever you encounter a 1.
3. Whenever you encounter a 0
   : a. Use the current count of 1's to find the maximum contiguous 1's till now.
   : b. Afterwards, reset the counter for 1's to 0.
4. Return the maximum in the end.

In the above diagram we found out that the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 3. There were two breaks in the count we encountered while iterating the array. Every time the break i.e. 0 was encountered we had to reset the count of 1 to zero.

> Note - The maximum count is only calculated when we encounter a break i.e. 0, since thats where a sub-array of 1's ends.

```
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = max_count = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                # Increment the count of 1's by one.
                count += 1
            else:
                # Find the maximum till now.
                max_count = max(max_count, count)
                # Reset count of 1.
                count = 0
        return max(max_count, count)

# Example input array
nums = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

# Call the function and print the result
print(findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums))
```

Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(N)O(N)O(N), where NNN is the number of elements in the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1). We do not use any extra space.

# For Better Understanding

## 1. for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)

Let's say Array nums is { 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 }

In for loop, 'i' starts from '0' and 'i' means 'index of nums array.

- In first loop, i = 0 &rarr; nums[0] = 1 so, count = 1
- In second loop, i = 1 &rarr; nums[1] = 0 so, reset count = 0
- In third loop, i = 2 &rarr; nums[2] = 1 so, count = 1
- In forth loop, i = 3 &rarr; nums[3] = 1 so, count = 2
- In fifth loop, i = 4 &rarr; nums[4] = 0 so, reset count = 0
- In sixth loop, i = 5 &rarr; nums[5] = 1 so, count = 1
- In seventh loop, i = 6 &rarr; nums[6] = 1 so, count = 2
- In eighth loop, i = 7 &rarr; nums[7] = 1 so, count = 3

<br>

## 2. maxCount = Math.Max(maxCount, count);

The line 'maxCount = Math.Max(maxCount, count);' is used to update the maxCount variable with the maximum value between its current value and the value of the count variable.

The maxCount variable keeps track of the maximum number of consecutive ones that have been encountered in the array so far. If count exceeds maxCount at any point during the loop, then maxCount is updated to the new maximum value.

<br>

## 3. return Math.Max(maxCount, count);

The reason we cannot return maxCount variable as the final result is that it may not always contain the correct value of the maximum consecutive ones. This is because if the nums array ends with consecutive ones, then the maxCount variable may not be updated with the correct value.

For example, if nums is {1, 1, 1}, when the for loop ends, maxCount will be set to 2. However, since the consecutive ones end at the end of the array, the count variable will be 3. In this case, we should return Math.Max(maxCount, count) to return the correct maximum consecutive ones value of 3.

Therefore, we need to return the maximum of maxCount and count using the Math.Max(maxCount, count) method in the return statement.
