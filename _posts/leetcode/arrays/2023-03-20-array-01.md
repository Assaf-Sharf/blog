## Problem

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

> Example 1:
>
> Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

> Example 2:
>
> Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
> Output: 2

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

## Solution

Approach: One pass

Intuition: We keep a count of the number of contiguous 1's encountered. Whenever we encounter a 0, we update the maximum number of contiguous 1's seen so far and reset the count.

Algorithm:

1. Initialize two variables, maxCount and count, to 0.
2. Iterate through the input array.
3. If the current element is 1, increment count.
4. If the current element is 0, update maxCount with the current count if it is greater than maxCount, then reset count to 0.
5. Return maxCount after the iteration is complete.

```
using System;

namespace max_consecutive_ones
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      int[] nums = new int[] { 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 };
      int result = FindMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums);
      Console.WriteLine(result);
    }

    public static int FindMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums)
    {
      int count = 0;
      int maxCount = 0;

      for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
      {
        if (nums[i] == 1)
        {
          count++;
        }
        else
        {
          maxCount = Math.Max(maxCount, count);
          count = 0;
        }
      }
      return Math.Max(maxCount, count);
    }
  }
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires finding the maximum number of consecutive ones in a binary array.

The program starts with the Main() method, which creates an array of integers called nums containing 1s and 0s. Then it calls the FindMaxConsecutiveOnes() method with nums as an argument and stores the result in the variable result. Finally, it prints the result using Console.WriteLine().

The FindMaxConsecutiveOnes() method takes an integer array called nums as an argument and returns an integer value, which is the maximum number of consecutive ones in the array.

The method initializes two integer variables, count and maxCount, to 0. It then loops through the elements of the input array nums using a for loop.

For each element, if it is 1, the method increments the count variable. If it is 0, the method checks if the current count is greater than the current maxCount. If it is, then maxCount is updated to the current count. Finally, the count variable is reset to 0.

After the loop completes, the method returns the maximum of maxCount and count using Math.Max() method, which is the maximum number of consecutive ones in the array.
