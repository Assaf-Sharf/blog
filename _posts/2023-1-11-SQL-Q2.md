## SQL Practice Problems (2)

Today, I solved more practice problems for SQL on school.programmers.co.kr, and  
I will be going over some of the questions that I did that I needed some time to research in order to solve.

### Finding the ratio of the number of customers who purchased the product

```
user_info
+-------------------------------------+
|Column name |   Type     |  Nullable |
+-------------------------------------+
|USER_ID     | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
|GENDER	     | TINYINT(1) |   TRUE    |
|AGE	     | INTEGER    |   TRUE    |
|JOINED	     | DATE       |   FALSE   |
+-------------------------------------+
Gender column is empty or either 0 or 1, which 0 is male, and 1 is female. 

online_sale
+--------------------------------------+
|Column name    |  Type    |  Nullable |
+--------------------------------------+
|ONLINE_SALE_ID |  INTEGER |   FALSE   |
|USER_ID        |  INTEGER |   FALSE   |
|PRODUCT_ID     |  INTEGER |   TRUE    |
|SALES_AMOUNT   |  INTEGER |   TRUE    |
|SALES_DATE     |  DATE    |   FALSE   |
+--------------------------------------+
There is only one sales data for same combination of date, user id, and product id.

Using user_info and online_sale tables, query the ratio of the number of customers
who purchased the product grouped by year and month and joined in 2021.
Round up the number of the ratio in the first decimal place, and order the result
in ascending order of year and month.
```

My First Attempt:
```sql
SELECT YEAR(sales_date) AS year
     , MONTH(sales_date) AS month
     , COUNT(DISTINCT os.user_id) AS purchased_users
     , ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT os.user_id) / COUNT(joined) AS purchased_ratio
FROM user_info AS ui
    INNER JOIN online_sale AS os ON ui.user_id = os.user_id
WHERE YEAR(joined) = 2021
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month
```
I thought I got the answer, but I was incorrect, so I was finding out where I could have gotten wrong. 
Then, I found out that ```COUNT(joined)``` only brought the numbers from the inner joined table, not the table from user_id. 
I had to find out the way to bring the whole number of customers who joined in 2021.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT YEAR(sales_date) AS year
     , MONTH(sales_date) AS month
     , COUNT(DISTINCT os.user_id) AS purchased_users
     , ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT os.user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*)
                                           FROM user_info
                                           WHERE YEAR(joined) = 2021), 1) AS purchased_ratio
FROM user_info AS ui
    INNER JOIN online_sale AS os ON ui.user_id = os.user_id
WHERE YEAR(joined) = 2021
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month
```
I wrote a sub-query to make bring the whole number of people who joined in 2021, and I got right. 
I realized it is important to know what table I am bringing the data from.

### Finding out the appointment that is not cancelled

```
patient
+--------------------------------------+
|Column name   |   Type    |  Nullable |
+--------------------------------------+
|PT_NO         | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|PT_NAME       | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|GEND_CD       | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|AGE           |  INTEGER  |   FALSE   |
|TLNO          | VARCHAR(N)|   TRUE    |
+--------------------------------------+
PT_NO: patient number
PT_NAME: patient name
GEND_CD: gender code
AGE: age
TLNO: telephone number

doctor
+--------------------------------------+
|Column name   |   Type    |  Nullable |
+--------------------------------------+
|DR_NAME       | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|DR_ID         | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|LCNS_NO       | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|HIRE_YMD      |   DATE    |   FALSE   |
|MCDP_CD       | VARCHAR(N)|   TRUE    |
|TLNO          | VARCHAR(N)|   TRUE    |
+--------------------------------------+
DR_NAME: doctor name
DR_ID: doctor id
LCNS_NO: license number
HIRE_YMD: hired date
MCDP_CD: medical specialty code
TLNO: telephone number

appointment
+--------------------------------------+
|Column name   |   Type    |  Nullable |
+--------------------------------------+
|APNT_YMD      | TIMESTAMP |   FALSE   |
|APNT_NO       |  INTEGER  |   FALSE   |
|PT_NO         | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|MCDP_CD       | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|MDDR_ID       | VARCHAR(N)|   FALSE   |
|APNT_CNCL_YN  | VARCHAR(N)|   TRUE    |
|APNT_CNCL_YMD |   DATE    |   TRUE    |
+--------------------------------------+
APNT_YMD: appointment date
APNT_NO: appointment number
PT_NO: patient number
MCDP_CD: medical specialty code
MDDR_ID: doctor id
APNT_CNCL_YN: whether the appointment was cancelled or not
APNT_CNCL_YMD: appointment cancelled date

From patient, doctor, and appointement table, find the appointment number, patient name,
patient number, medical specialty code, doctor name, and appointment date of the appointments
from cardiothoracic surgery(CS) field that was not cancelled on 2022-04-13.
```

I did not know how to join more than two tables, so I had to do some research to find out how to join 3 tables. 

My first attempt:
```sql
SELECT apnt_no, pt.pt_name, pt.pt_no, dr.mcdp_cd, dr.dr_name, apnt_ymd
FROM appointment AS ap
    INNER JOIN patient AS pt ON ap.pt_no = pt.pt_no
    INNER JOIN doctor AS dr ON ap.mddr_id = dr.dr_id
WHERE dr.mcdp_cd = 'CS'
AND DATE(apnt_ymd) = '2022-04-13'
ORDER BY apnt_ymd
```
The table seemed right, and I could not find what I got wrong from this code for a long time, 
and I realized that I did not write out one condition, which was 'appointment that was not cancelled'. 
The result looked the same when I ran the code, but writing out the condition and not writing it out makes a big difference 
since it will make a different result with different test cases.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT apnt_no, pt.pt_name, pt.pt_no, dr.mcdp_cd, dr.dr_name, apnt_ymd
FROM appointment AS ap
    INNER JOIN patient AS pt ON ap.pt_no = pt.pt_no
    INNER JOIN doctor AS dr ON ap.mddr_id = dr.dr_id
WHERE dr.mcdp_cd = 'CS'
AND DATE(apnt_ymd) = '2022-04-13'
AND apnt_cncl_ymd IS NULL
ORDER BY apnt_ymd
```
I added the condition and got the problem right.

Today's problems gave me a new technique to use (joining 3 or more tables) and more knowledge of 
how and when to write sub-query.
