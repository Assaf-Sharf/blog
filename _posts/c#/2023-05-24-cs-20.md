# Access Modifiers

The public keyword is an access modifier, which is used to set the access level/visibility for classes, fields, methods and properties.

C# has the following access modifiers:

| Modifier  | Description                                                                                    |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| public    | The code is accessible for all classes.                                                        |
| private   | The code is only accessible within the same class.                                             |
| protected | The code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited from that class. |
| internal  | The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly.            |

There's also two combinations: protected internal and private protected.

## Private Modifier

If you declare a field with a private access modifier, it can only be accessed within the same class:

```
class Car
{
  private string model = "Mustang";

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.model);
  }
}

// Output: Mustang
```

If you try to access it outside the class, an error will occur:

```
class Car
{
  private string model = "Mustang";
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.model);
  }
}

// Error: 'Car.model' is inaccessible due to its protection level
The field 'Car.model' is assigned but its value is never used
```

<br>

## Public Modifier

If you declare a field with a public access modifier, it is accessible for all classes:

```
class Car
{
  public string model = "Mustang";
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.model);
  }
}

// Output: Mustang
```

Why Access Modifiers?

To control the visibility of class members (the security level of each individual class and class member).

To achieve "Encapsulation" - which is the process of making sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. This is done by declaring fields as private.

By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access modifier:

```
class Car
{
  string model;  // private
  string year;   // private
}
```
