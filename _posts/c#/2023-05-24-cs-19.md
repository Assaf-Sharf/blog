# Class Members

Fields and methods inside classes are often referred to as "Class Members."

Create a Car class with three class members: two fields and one method:

```
// The class
class MyClass
{
  // Class members
  string color = "red"; // field
  int maxSpeed = 200; // field

  public void fullThrottle() // method
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }
}
```

<br>

## Fields

- Variables inside a class are called fields.
- Access fields by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot syntax (.).

Create an object of the Car class, with the name myObj. Then we print the value of the fields color and maxSpeed:

```
class Car
{
  string color = "red";
  int maxSpeed = 200;

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();

    Console.WriteLine(myObj.color);
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.maxSpeed);
  }
}
```

You can also leave the fields blank, and modify them when creating the object:

```
class Car
{
  string color;
  int maxSpeed;

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();

    myObj.color = "red";
    myObj.maxSpeed = 200;

    Console.WriteLine(myObj.color);
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.maxSpeed);
  }
}
```

This(Leave the fields blank) is especially useful when creating multiple objects of one class:

```
class Car
{
  string model;
  string color;
  int year;

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car();
    Ford.model = "Mustang";
    Ford.color = "red";
    Ford.year = 1969;

    Car Opel = new Car();
    Opel.model = "Astra";
    Opel.color = "white";
    Opel.year = 2005;

    Console.WriteLine(Ford.model);
    Console.WriteLine(Opel.model);
  }
}
```

<br>

## Object Methods

- Methods normally belongs to a class, and they define how an object of a class behaves.
- Access methods with the dot syntax.
- Note that the method must be public. And remember that we use the name of the method followed by two parantheses () and a semicolon ; to call (execute) the method.

```
class Car
{
  string color; // field
  int maxSpeed; // field

  public void fullThrottle() // method
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();
    myObj.fullThrottle(); // Call the method
  }
}
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

Why did we declare the method as public, and not static, like in the examples from the C# Methods Chapter?

The reason is simple: a static method can be accessed without creating an object of the class, while public methods can only be accessed by objects.

## Use Multiple Classes

We can use multiple classes for better organization (one for fields and methods, and another one for execution).

One for fields and methods:

```
class Car
{
  public string model;
  public string color;
  public int year;

  public void fullThrottle()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }
}
```

One for execution:

```
class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car();
    Ford.model = "Mustang";
    Ford.color = "red";
    Ford.year = 1969;

    Car Opel = new Car();
    Opel.model = "Astra";
    Opel.color = "white";
    Opel.year = 2005;

    Console.WriteLine(Ford.model);
    Console.WriteLine(Opel.model);
  }
}
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

The public keyword is called an access modifier, which specifies that the fields of Car are accessible for other classes as well, such as Program.

# Constructors

A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The advantage of a constructor, is that it is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for fields.

Create a constructor:

```
// Create a Car class
class Car
{
  public string model; // Create a field

  // Create a class constructor for the Car class
  public Car()
  {
    model = "Mustang"; // Set the initial value for model
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car(); // Create an object of the Car class (This will call the constructor)
    Console.WriteLine(Ford.model); // Print the value of model
  }
}

// Output: "Mustang"
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void or int).

Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.

All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, C# creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for fields.

Constructors save time! Take a look at the last example on this page to really understand why.

<br>

## Constructor Parameters

Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize fields.

The following example adds a string modelName parameter to the constructor. Inside the constructor we set model to modelName (model=modelName). When we call the constructor, we pass a parameter to the constructor ("Mustang"), which will set the value of model to "Mustang".

```
class Car
{
  public string model;

  // Create a class constructor with a parameter
  public Car(string modelName)
  {
    model = modelName;
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car("Mustang");
    Console.WriteLine(Ford.model);
  }
}

// Output: "Mustang"
```

You can have as many parameters as you want:

```
class Car
{
  public string model;
  public string color;
  public int year;

  // Create a class constructor with multiple parameters
  public Car(string modelName, string modelColor, int modelYear)
  {
    model = modelName;
    color = modelColor;
    year = modelYear;
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car("Mustang", "Red", 1969);
    Console.WriteLine(Ford.color + " " + Ford.year + " " + Ford.model);
  }
}

// Outputs Red 1969 Mustang
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

Tip: Just like other methods, constructors can be overloaded by using different numbers of parameters.

## Constructors Save Time

Constructors are very useful, as they help reducing the amount of code.

Without constructor:

```
class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car();
    Ford.model = "Mustang";
    Ford.color = "red";
    Ford.year = 1969;

    Car Opel = new Car();
    Opel.model = "Astra";
    Opel.color = "white";
    Opel.year = 2005;

    Console.WriteLine(Ford.model);
    Console.WriteLine(Opel.model);
  }
}
```

With constructor:

```
class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car("Mustang", "Red", 1969);
    Car Opel = new Car("Astra", "White", 2005);

    Console.WriteLine(Ford.model);
    Console.WriteLine(Opel.model);
  }
}
```

# Static and Non-Static Members

What are <u>Static Members</u> and <u>Non-Static Members</u> in C#?

The member of a class is divided into two categories.

The members (Variables, Constructors, and Methods) which are created by using the static modifier are called static members rest of all are called non-static members.

In other words, we can also define that, the members of a class that does not require an instance either for initialization or execution are known as the static member. On the other hand, the members which require an instance of a class for both initialization and execution are known as non-static members.

<br>

## Variables

Whenever we declare a variable by using the static modifier or when we declare a variable inside of any static block, then those variables are considered static variables whereas the rest of the others are considered non-static variables.

```
public class Program
{
  int x = 10; // Non-Static Variable
  static int y = 20; // Static Variable

  public static void Main() // Static Block
  {
    int a = 10; // By Default Static
  }

  void SomeMethod() // Non-Static Block
  {
    int b = 10; // By Default Non-Static
  }
}
```

### Static Variables

If a variable is declared static, we can access the variable using the class name.

```
using System;

namespace StaticKeyword
{
  class Student
  {
    public static string department = "Computer Science"; // Static Variable
  }

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Department: " + Student.department); // Access static variable

      Console.ReadLine();
    }
  }
}
```

### Static Variable VS Instance Variable

In C#, every object of a class will have its own copy of instance variables.

```
class Student
{
  public string studentName; // Instance Variable
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Student s1 = new Student();
    Student s2 = new Student();
  }
}
```

- Here, both the objects s1 and s2 will have separate copies of the variable studentName. And, they are different from each other.
- However, if we declare a variable static, all objects of the class share the same static variable. And, we don't need to create objects of the class to access the static variables.

```
using System;

namespace StaticKeyword
{
  class Student
  {
    static public string schoolName = "Centennial"; // Static
    public string studentName; // Instance(Non-Static)
  }

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Student s1 = new Student();
      s1.StudentName = "Bill";

      // Call the Instance Variable
      Console.WriteLine("Name: " + s1.studentName);

      // Call the Static Variable
      Console.WriteLine("School: " + Student.schoolName);

      //======================================================

      Student s2 = new Student();
      s2.StudentName = "Bill";

      // Call the Instance Variable
      Console.WriteLine("Name: " + s2.studentName);

      // Call the Static Variable
      Console.WriteLine("School: " + Student.schoolName);

      Console.ReadLine();
    }
  }
}
```

<br>

## Methods

Just like static variables, we can call the static methods using the class name.

```
class Test
{
  public static void display()
  {
    //Code statement
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Test.display(); // Method is called using class name
  }
}
```

### Static and Non-Static Methods

```
using System;

namespace StaticKeyword
{
  class Test
  {
    public void display1()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Non static method");
    }

    public static void display2()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Static method");
    }
  }

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Test t1 = new Test();

      t1.display1(); // Non-Static
      Test.display2(); // Static

      Console.ReadLine();
    }
  }
}
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

Console.ReadLine()은 사용자의 입력을 기다리고, 사용자가 엔터 키를 누를 때까지 프로그램의 실행을 일시적으로 정지시킵니다. 이렇게 함으로써 프로그램이 종료되지 않고 사용자가 결과를 확인할 수 있도록 합니다.

Main 메서드가 실행되면 프로그램은 코드를 위에서 아래로 순차적으로 실행하고, 마지막 줄인 Console.ReadLine()에 도달하면 프로그램이 멈추고 사용자 입력을 기다리게 됩니다. 사용자가 입력을 하고 엔터 키를 누르면 프로그램이 종료됩니다. 이렇게 함으로써 콘솔 창이 바로 닫히지 않고 결과를 확인할 수 있는 시간을 제공합니다.
