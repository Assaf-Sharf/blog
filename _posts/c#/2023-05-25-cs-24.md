# Abstract Classes and Methods

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.

Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

The abstract keyword is used for classes and methods:

- Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:

```
abstract class Animal
{
  public abstract void animalSound();

  public void sleep()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}
```

From the example above, it is not possible to create an object of the Animal class:

```
Animal myObj = new Animal();
// Will generate an error (Cannot create an instance of the abstract class or interface 'Animal')
```

To access the abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. Convert the Animal class using Polymorphism to an abstract class.

{% capture notice-2 %}

Remember that we use the : symbol to inherit from a class, and that we use the override keyword to override the base class method.
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--danger">{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}</div>

```
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal
{
  // Abstract method(does not have a body)
  public abstract void animalSound();

  // Regular method
  public void sleep()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}

// Derived class (inherit from Animal)
class Pig : Animal
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Pig myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound(); // Call the abstract method
    myPig.sleep(); // Call the regular method
  }
}
```

Why And When To Use Abstract Classes and Methods?

To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.

# Interfaces

Another way to achieve abstraction in C#, is with interfaces.

An interface is a completely "abstract class", which can only contain abstract methods and properties (with empty bodies):

```
// interface
interface Animal
{
  void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  void run(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

It is considered good practice to start with the letter "I" at the beginning of an interface, as it makes it easier for yourself and others to remember that it is an interface and not a class.

By default, members of an interface are abstract and public.

Note: Interfaces can contain properties and methods, but not fields.
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--danger">{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}</div>

To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class. To implement an interface, use the : symbol (just like with inheritance). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class. Note that you do not have to use the override keyword when implementing an interface:

```
// Interface
interface IAnimal
{
  void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the IAnimal interface
class Pig : IAnimal
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Pig myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
  }
}
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

Notes on Interfaces:

- Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects (in the example above, it is not possible to create an "IAnimal" object in the Program class).
- Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class.
- On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods.
- Interfaces can contain properties and methods, but not fields/variables.
- Interface members are by default abstract and public.
- An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects).

Why And When To Use Interfaces?

- To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface).
- C# does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one base class). However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces. Note: To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma.

## Multiple Interfaces

To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma:

```
interface IFirstInterface
{
  void myMethod(); // interface method
}

interface ISecondInterface
{
  void myOtherMethod(); // interface method
}

// Implement multiple interfaces
class DemoClass : IFirstInterface, ISecondInterface
{
  public void myMethod()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Some text...");
  }
  public void myOtherMethod()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Some other text...");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    DemoClass myObj = new DemoClass();

    myObj.myMethod();
    myObj.myOtherMethod();
  }
}
```
