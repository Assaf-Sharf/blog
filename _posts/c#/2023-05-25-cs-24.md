# Inheritance (Derived and Base Class)

In C#, it is possible to inherit fields and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

- Derived Class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
- Base Class (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.

In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the fields and methods from the Vehicle class (parent):

```
class Vehicle // base class (parent)
{
  public string brand = "Ford"; // vehicle field

  public void honk() // vehicle method
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Tuut, tuut!");
  }
}

class Car : Vehicle // derived class (child)
{
  public string modelName = "Mustang"; // car field
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    // create a myCar object
    Car myCar = new Car();

    // call the honk() method (From the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
    myCar.honk();

    // display the value of the brand field (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
    Console.WriteLine(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
  }
}
```

Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?

- It is useful for code reusability: reuse fields and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.

Tip: Also take a look at Polymorphism, which uses inherited methods to perform different tasks.

# The sealed Keyword

If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the sealed keyword:

If you try to access a sealed class, C# will generate an error:

```
sealed class Vehicle
{
  // code statement
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
  // code statement
}

// Error: 'Car': cannot derive from sealed type 'Vehicle'
```

# Polymorphism and Overriding Methods

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified before; Inheritance lets us inherit fields and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

For example, think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):

```
class Animal  // Base class (parent)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}
```

Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and call the animalSound() method on both of them:

```
class Animal  // Base class (parent)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object
    Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object

    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myPig.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
  }
}

/* Output:
The animal makes a sound
The animal makes a sound
The animal makes a sound
*/
```

### Not The Output I Was Looking For

The output from the example above was probably not what you expected. That is because the base class method overrides the derived class method, when they share the same name.

However, C# provides an option to override the base class method, by adding the virtual keyword to the method inside the base class, and by using the override keyword for each derived class methods:

```
class Animal // Base class(parent)
{
  public virtual void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig : Animal // Derived class (child)
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog : Animal // Derived class (child)
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow bow");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Create a Animal object
    Animal myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
    Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Create a Dog object

    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myPig.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
  }
}

/* Output:
The animal makes a sound
The pig says: wee wee
The dog says: bow wow
*/
```
