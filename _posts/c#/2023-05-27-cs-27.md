# Operator overloading

Operator overloading in C# allows you to define custom implementations for operators, such as **`+`**, **`-`**, **`*`**, **`/`**, **`==`**, **`!=`**, and more, for your own custom types. It enables you to use operators with your objects in a way that makes sense based on the context and behavior of your types.

To overload an operator, you need to define a special method within your class that corresponds to the operator you want to overload. These methods are called operator overloading methods. They are defined using the `operator` keyword followed by the operator you want to overload.

```
//Operator Overloading
using System;
namespace OperatorOverloadingDemo
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Complex c1 = new Complex(3, 7);
      c1.Display();
      Complex c2 = new Complex(5, 2);
      c2.Display();
      Complex c3 = c1 + c2;
      c3.Display();
      Console.ReadKey();
    }
  }

  public class Complex
  {
    private int real;
    private int img;
    public Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0)
    {
      real = r;
      img = i;
    }
    public static Complex operator +(Complex c1, Complex c2)
    {
      Complex temp = new Complex();
      temp.real = c1.real + c2.real;
      temp.img = c1.img + c2.img;
      return temp;
    }
    public void Display()
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"{real} + i{img}");
    }
  }
}
```
