Previously I described how we can perform Discrete Optimization using the Branch and Bound technique. Today I want to describe another fundamental technique which is often a subcomponent of more advanced solution algorithms, Cutting Planes. Cutting Planes is a technique that was initially created by Gomory in (date). It is like the Branch and Bound technique in that uses an LP Relaxation to search for solutions but it has a different mechanism for excluding nonintegral solutions. Branch and Bound would subdivide the solution space by branching on the values that a decision variable can take on by creating constraints which would restrict the decision variable to either take on the value of the adjacent integer values.

Cutting Planes actually introduces as series of additional constraints which slowly constricts the solution space. It does this in such a way that none of the feasible integral solutions are eliminated from the feasible set of values though.
