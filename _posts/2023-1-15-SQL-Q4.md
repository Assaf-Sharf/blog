## SQL Practice Problems (4)

Today, I solved more practice problems for SQL on HackerRank and LeetCode, and  
I will be going over some of the questions that I did that I needed some time to research or think in order to solve. 
I focused on practicing how to write sub-query.

### Department Highest Salary

This problem is from LeetCode:

```
Employee
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+

Department
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+

Write an SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.
```

Solution:
```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department
     , e.name AS Employee
     , e.salary AS Salary
FROM employee AS e
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT departmentid, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
        FROM employee
        GROUP BY departmentid
    ) AS dh ON e.departmentid = dh.departmentid
    INNER JOIN department AS d ON e.departmentid = d.id
WHERE e.salary = dh.max_salary
```
I wrote a sub-query in the FROM statement to bring the maximum salary for each department, 
and I put a condition to only include as a result if the salary is equal to the maximum salary for the certain department.

### Challenges

This problem is from HackerRank:

```
Hackers
+------------+---------+
|   Column   |  Type   |
+------------+---------+
| hacker_id  | Integer |
|    name    | String  |
+------------+---------+

Challenges
+---------------+---------+
|     Column    |  Type   |
+---------------+---------+
| challenge_id  | Integer |
|   hacker_id   | Integer |
+---------------+---------+

Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, 
then exclude those students from the result.
```

Solution:
```sql
SELECT h.hacker_id
     , name
     , COUNT(*) challenges_created
FROM challenges AS c
    INNER JOIN hackers AS h ON c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, name
HAVING challenges_created = (SELECT MAX(challenges_created)
                             FROM (SELECT hacker_id, COUNT(*) AS challenges_created
                                   FROM challenges
                                   GROUP BY hacker_id
                                  ) sub)
OR challenges_created IN (SELECT challenges_created
                          FROM (SELECT hacker_id, COUNT(*) AS challenges_created
                                FROM challenges
                                GROUP BY hacker_id
                                ) sub
                          GROUP BY challenges_created
                          HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
                          )
ORDER BY challenges_created DESC, hacker_id
```

This code has a lot of process due to the conditions this problem have. 
This is the list of how to solve the problem

1) Need to count the number of challenges each hackers created
2) See if the count corresponds to the maximum number of the challenges_created. If so, include in the result.
3) If condition 2 does not match, see if there are more than one person who created the same amount of challenges. If so, exclude the result.

Condition corresponds to this part of the code:
```sql
SELECT h.hacker_id
     , name
     , COUNT(*) challenges_created
FROM challenges AS c
    INNER JOIN hackers AS h ON c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, name
ORDER BY challenges_created DESC, hacker_id
```
I put condition 2 and 3 in the HAVING statement. Condition 2 corresponds to this part:
```sql
HAVING challenges_created = (SELECT MAX(challenges_created)
                             FROM (SELECT hacker_id, COUNT(*) AS challenges_created
                                   FROM challenges
                                   GROUP BY hacker_id
                                  ) sub)
```
I wrote a sub-query to bring the amount of challenges created and brought the maximum value of the challenges created. 
Data that corresponds to this condition will be included in the result.

Condition 3 corresponds to this part:
```sql
OR challenges_created IN (SELECT challenges_created
                          FROM (SELECT hacker_id, COUNT(*) AS challenges_created
                                FROM challenges
                                GROUP BY hacker_id
                                ) sub
                          GROUP BY challenges_created
                          HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
                          )
```
I wrote a sub-query to bring the number of challenges created that excludes the data of the amount of challenges that are overlapped by more than 2 people. 
By this way, if the number of challenges created is in this sub-query, the data will be included since it would mean that the number is not overlapped.

However, the code above seems very inefficient due to the overlapping sub-query. This problem can be solved by using WITH statement:
```sql
WITH counter AS (
    SELECT h.hacker_id
         , h.name
         , COUNT(*) AS challenges_created
    FROM challenges AS c
        INNER JOIN hackers AS h ON c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
    GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
)

SELECT counter.hacker_id
     , counter.name
     , counter.challenges_created
FROM counter
WHERE challenges_created = (SELECT MAX(challenges_created) FROM counter)
OR challenges_created IN (SELECT challenges_created
                          FROM counter
                          GROUP BY challenges_created
                          HAVING COUNT(*) = 1)
ORDER BY counter.challenges_created DESC, counter.hacker_id
```
By using a sub-query in WITH statement, I made it be able to reference from this without having to re-write all the sub-query repeatedly.

I especially had difficulty solving the second problem. 
I think one of the major reason is that I am still not familiar with using sub-query, 
so using sub-query repeatedly like the second problem was a difficult task for my current level. 
I will try to solve more problems using sub-query to get used to the concept and be able to use it more easily.
