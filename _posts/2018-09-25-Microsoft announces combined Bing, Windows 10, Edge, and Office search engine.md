<p><p>Tech giant Microsoft is implementing a unified search system across its various software products.</p>
<p>Microsoft Search is a new initiative by Microsoft to merge and incorporate the search results of their products across several sectors into one unified service. This includes the search results from its Bing search engine, as well as the results from searching on a Windows 10 desktop or an installation of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>The first steps for this search unification is to make the search bar placement consistent across all of Microsoft's services. As Microsoft's Corporate Vice President for OneDrive, SharePoint, and Office Jeff Teper puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Outlook to PowerPoint, Excel to Sway, OneNote to Microsoft Teams, Office.com to SharePoint, the search bar will be in the same placeâ€”across desktop, mobile, and web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These results will also include content from the organization the user's <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/windows-10/'><img alt='Small Windows 10 icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/windows-10_82838.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Windows 10</a> PC or Office installation belongs to.</p>
<p>As for a time table for Microsoft Search's availability, it is currently available on <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/bingcom/'><img alt='Small Bing icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/bingcom_81350.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Bing</a>, Office.com, and the mobile apps for Outlook and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-sharepoint/'><img alt='Small Microsoft SharePoint icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/microsoft-sharepoint_72559.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Microsoft SharePoint</a>. Teper also states that Microsoft Search will be implemented in all versions of the <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-office-suite/'><img alt='Small Microsoft Office Suite icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/microsoft-office-suite_68400.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Microsoft Office Suite</a> as well as Windows 10 in the first half of 2019.</p>
