##### The abstract

Docker has changed the way applications are built and run. However, one of the frequent pain points for newcomers is configuration of the containers - what are `ENV`, `ARG`, environment, `.env` file etc. This session will attempt to answer some of these questions and illustrate options of configuring Docker (and Docker Compose) containers.
