<p><p>Facebook's founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg is looking to have a unified framework behind the messaging functionalities of all three of its messaging apps.</p>
<p>The social network giant is in the early stages of merging the technical infrastructure behind <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/facebook-messenger/'><img alt='Small Facebook Messenger icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/facebook-messenger_40294.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/whatsapp/'><img alt='Small WhatsApp Messenger icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/whatsapp_58669.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />WhatsApp Messenger</a>, and the messaging platform built in to <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/instagram/'><img alt='Small Instagram icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/instagram_112969.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Instagram</a>. Despite this unification, the three messaging services will continue to operate separately from one another.</p>
<p>One of the primary goals of this merger plan is to implement end-to-end encryption in Messenger and Instagram, saying this to The New York Times:<br />
&quot;[We want to] build the best messaging experiences we can; and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private. We’re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks.”</p>
<p>In a statement to The Verge, a spokesperson for Facebook said the following:<br />
“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can; and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private. We’re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”</p>
<p>According to The New York Times, this infrastructure transition process is planned to be completed by the end of 2019 or in early 2020. This change will utilize thousands of Facebook's employees reworking the fundamental properties and functionality of all three messaging services. In the meantime, WhatsApp is the only one of the three with standardized end-to-end encryption present throughout the app, and has alternatives such as <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/signal-private-messenger/'><img alt='Small Signal icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/signal-private-messenger_104976.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Signal</a> and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/telegram/'><img alt='Small Telegram icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/telegram_122545.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Telegram</a> that are also encrypted end-to-end.</p>
