<p><p>Russia has launched a civil suit against search giant Google. The nation is accusing the company of failing to comply with a legal obligation to omit select results from search queries polled from Russian IP addresses, as well as not joining a Russia-operated registry curating banned sites possibly containing illegal information.</p>
<p>If Google fails to prove its innocence and is found guilty, it may be fined up to almost 10.5 thousand U.S. dollars. According to the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-alphabet-lawsuit/russia-opens-civil-case-against-google-watchdog-idUSKCN1NV1L6" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>), the court's final decision on the suit will be made in December.</p>
<p>As of the publication of this article, Google has refrained from commenting to Reuters or other inquiring news sites.</p>
