excerpt: "New publication in Optics Express"
---

I am happy to anounce a new publication in the renowned Optics Express Journal (h-index 271). 
Its idea centers around the design of free-form lenses to improve optical assembly and hand-eye calibration.

Feel free to take a look at it [here](http://www.google.com).
