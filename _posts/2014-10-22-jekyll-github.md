## Why


## What


## How

I built this site on [Github](http://github.com), supported by the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) using [Michael Rose's](https://mademistakes.com) [Minimal Mistakes project](http://github.com/mmistakes).

Minimal Mistakes is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 2.2+. Make sure to run `gem update jekyll` if you aren't on the latest version or `gem install jekyll` if this is your first time installing it.

If you are creating a new Jekyll site using Minimal Mistakes follow these steps:

1. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork).
2. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
3. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
4. Update `config.yml`, add navigation, and replace demo posts and pages with your own.
