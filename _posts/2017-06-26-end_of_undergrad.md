Today was the last day of my undergraduate degree. I woke up incredibly late after spending the evening with Corinne, then went for a walk around the city centre. I was elated at having received my 2:1 and attempted to soak up the beauty of Oxford in Summer before returning to Birmingham. I bought a college plaque and cufflinks to commemorate finishing my first degree, remembering vividly first seeing with a naive sense of awe the Teddy Hall plaque hanging in the Mr El Habid's classroom during Philosophy of Religion classes at school. 

After leaving the shop I checked my phone and saw an email titled 'Association of Physicians Undergraduate Studentship Prize and British Society for Immunology Prize (nomination)'. I was grinning, but the mobile data was too slow to load the two attachments. I opened them sitting on the bench in Old Quad - my research project was the source of both letters. I wrote an email to Dr Dennis expressing my sincerest thanks for his teaching these last three years.
