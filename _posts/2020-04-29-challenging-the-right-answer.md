Your rough hand on my shoulder

while you challenge my correct answer.

Making me question if I am using the formula of comfort to solve it.

&nbsp;  

Your hand is like a cool day in spring

chilly enough to remind me that I still have a ways to go till summer

yet warm enough to push me along.

&nbsp;  


Challenging me to chase the problem freely,

under the sun,

unafraid to get lost,

excited about what I will find.


&nbsp;  

Exploring every possible course

to the answer I seek.

Like a boy joyfully biking through his city

knowing that he will somehow find his way,

is far more rewarding than taking the same route home,

with fear of wandering astray.
