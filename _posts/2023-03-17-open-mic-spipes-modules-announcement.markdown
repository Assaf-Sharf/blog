The Open mic session starts on Friday 3 March 2023 at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). The speaker [Bogdan Kostov](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#bogdan-kostov) will present an data integration case for updating data from an external data source view.


##### The abstract

Data integration is one of the common problems occurring in modern distributed applications. Data integration is a problem where data needs to be integrated across multiple applications with their own data storage that may have different schemas.

In this session we will discuss a data integration scenario where a data source needs to be updated from a second data source view. A potential solution will be presented.
