# Welcome to this course

On behalf of all the lecturers I wish you a very warm welcome to this course. This is the second time we are running this course. While we have put much effort into making it as good as we can, there may still be unforeseen obstacles that we may have to resolve as we go. We hope that you will forgive us in advance if everything does not run without hiccups from the onset, and we will be on the forum on Mondo to check your questions during the course. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask!

Also note that due to not having updated to the latest web-standard, __Firefox does not__ display the course page very well. You will have to install any of these free alternatives to view the course properly: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Mac: Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com).

You will find all lecture materials here, by navigating the menu at the upper left corner. Each page also has a link at the bottom to the next page, which follows the sequence of the lectures. The course will be made available in four parts (see schedule below), each part containing two modules as seen in the first level of the menu. There will be two essay assignments, one at the end of Part 2 and one at the end of Part 4. The instructions for the essay assignment and the quizzes will be available on the MONDO platform. While you can take all the required quizzes at any time before the deadline on the 20th of March, I encourage you to try to do them as you read through the lectures. You will also be required to make four summaries of important insights, one for each part of the course. For this, there will be one forum thread for each group (you will be assigned groups) in which you can discuss amongst each other what you found most insightful. Participation in this group discussion is required.

Any question you might have, please use the forums on MONDO so everyone can see both questions and answers. I hope you will enjoy this course as much as we have enjoyed making it! 

Sincerely, [Jon Norberg](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/21/contact/staff/9-19-2008-norberg.html), Professor at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University and __Ashley Perl__, TA on this course, Msc at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University
