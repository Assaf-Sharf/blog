<p><p>Instagram users will now be able to publish posts to multiple user accounts straight from the New Post page. This feature is initially being made available on the iOS app for the social network.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/instagram/'><img alt='Small Instagram icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/instagram_112969.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Instagram</a> revealed the feature and its iOS exclusive initial rollout <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/instagram-self-regram/" rel="nofollow">to TechCrunch</a>, telling the news site the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are rolling out this feature to provide a better experience for people who often post to multiple accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This move will make it so users managing multiple business, creative, or personal accounts can publish the same content across multiple audiences simultaneously, saving both time and effort in the process.

<p>Plans for rolling out simultaneous posts on multiple accounts on Instagram outside of the <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_88776.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a> app have not yet been disclosed.</p>
