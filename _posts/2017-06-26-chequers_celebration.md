To celebrate the monetary award for my research project I went to Chequers with those still left in Oxford. I paid for an uncharicteristic round in celebration, with Lee inevitably buying my second in celebration also. We spent the evening discussing our secondary schools and the differences between the state schools of Dan, Lee, Ben and myself and Tristan's RGS and Eton.
