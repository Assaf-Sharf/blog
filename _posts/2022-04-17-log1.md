## Prologue

---
After learning HTML and CSS, I was eager to learn a new language - *JavaScript* - and I was searching the best way to grasp the basics of JS. Then I found this ***'30 Days Of JavaScript'*** Challenge at GitHub, and now I'm at Day 3.

It has only been four days, but I can guarantee that the program is well-written! The best part is that it provides bunch of exercises at the end of the lesson, and I find it so helpful. Today, I spent my day learning markdown syntaxes from [Wes Bos][1] so that I can post what I've learned on my blog. From now on, I'm planning on uploading TIL(Today I Learned) along with my answers of exercise quizzes. Let's get started!
