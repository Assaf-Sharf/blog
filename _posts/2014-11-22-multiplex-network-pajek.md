## the Figures

Figure 1 and 2 both illustrates the logic of our models, representing the negative and the perceived ethnicity networks in one class from our sample. On both figures, black arrows mean ethnic nominations and the gray ones stand for the negative relations. Self-declared Roma students are represented with squares and non-Roma students with circles. The colors of the nodes depend on the number of the incoming perceived ethnic nominations so the higher indegree the node has the darker the color is. Finally, whereas on Figure 1 the bigger the node is the more incoming negative nominations that student has, on Figure 2 the node size depends on the outgoing negative nominations.
