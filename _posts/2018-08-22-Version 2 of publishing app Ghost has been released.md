<p>Popular open-source blog writing and publishing software Ghost has just released its version 2.0 update.</p><p>As announced through [Ghost's official blog](https://blog.ghost.org/2-0/), the blog writing and publishing application's 2.0 release is one that focuses on power and flexibility. This release is the culmination of over 1,500 commits to Ghost's [GitHub page](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost).</p><p>Some of the major new features for this 2.0 release include (thanks to [Ugotsta](https://alternativeto.net/user/ugotsta/) for the list):<br/>- New, context-sensitive editor that's simple but extensible.<br/>- Dynamic blocks for story building to add content like HTML or embeds from YouTube, Twitter, etc.<br/>- SEO-friendly, multi-lingual support.<br/>- Content Collections for different content types.<br/>- Dynamic routing allowing unlimited flexibility in a site's structure (this is what powers many of the new features).</p><p>As noted on the announcement blog post, Markdown is no longer the default writing method in Ghost (though it is still available for users that prefer it). The editor is brand new, with the post describing it as such: "Imagine https://alternativeto.net/software/medium/’s editor and https://alternativeto.net/software/slack/’s integrations had a beautiful illegitimate lovechild. That’s the vibe we set out to accomplish."</p><p>Users upgrading to version 2.0 https://alternativeto.net/software/ghost/ will be able to in about 15 minutes if they follow the [official migration guide](https://docs.ghost.org/docs/migrating-to-ghost-2-0-0), according to the blog post.</p>
