<p><p>In an effort to include more built-in web-based tools into Chrome OS that take advantage of the now standard pen and stylus support that most devices that run operating system enjoy, Google has launched a new doodling app called Chrome Canvas.</p>
<p>Chrome Canvas gives users a responsive progressive web app that's constantly synchronized to their Google Account and accessible easily on Chrome OS, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-chrome/'><img alt='Small Google Chrome icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-chrome_96565.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Chrome</a>, or any other <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/chromium/-powered'><img alt='Small Chromium icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/chromium_79310.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Chromium</a> web browser. Though simple and straightforward compared to other drawing apps that can be found on Android or other operating systems, it features dramatically less latency and doesn't require a download from any app store.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/chrome-canvas/'><img alt='Small Chrome Canvas icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/chrome-canvas_137053.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Chrome Canvas</a> can be used by visiting <a href='https://canvas.apps.chrome/' rel='nofollow'>https://canvas.apps.chrome/ </a> from any Chromium-based web browser (though, as of this writing, Firefox also works) or pre-installed on the Dev release channel for <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/chrome-os/'><img alt='Small Google Chrome OS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/chrome-os_125646.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Chrome OS</a>.</p>
