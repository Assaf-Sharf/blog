## Abstract:

> Recent advances in deep learning-based image processing have enabled significant im-
provements in multiple computer vision fields, with crowd counting being no exception. Crowd
counting is still attracting research interest due to its potential usefulness for traffic and pedestrian
stream monitoring and analysis. This study considered a specific case of crowd counting, namely,
counting based on low-altitude aerial images collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle. We evaluated
a range of neural network architectures to find ones appropriate for on-board image processing using
edge computing devices while minimising the loss in performance. Through experiments on a range
of neural network architectures, we also showed that the input image resolution significantly impacts
the prediction quality and should be considered an important factor before going for a more complex
neural network model to improve accuracy. Moreover, by extending a state-of-the-art benchmark
with more in-depth testing, we showed that larger models might be prone to overfitting because of
the relative scarcity of training data.
