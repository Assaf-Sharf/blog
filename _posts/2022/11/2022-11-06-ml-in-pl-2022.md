Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of participating in [ML in PL 2022 conference](https://conference2022.mlinpl.org/) at the University of Warsaw, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics. Its agenda covered keynote lectures, panel discussions, networking, and poster sessions. The event is mainly focused on machine Learning, both in academia and in business.
