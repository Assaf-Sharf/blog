For some reason&nbsp;setup can show this message when finish: "<EM>You did not meet all of the pre requisites. Connected service framework may or may not work until you meet those requirements. Please see Deployment guide.</EM>" You can ignore it because (1) sometime it is shown also when there is no problem at all (2) there is no way to know witch is the requirement not satisfied.
