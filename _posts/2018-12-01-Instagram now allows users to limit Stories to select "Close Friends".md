<p><p>Photo sharing social network Instagram's popular Stories feature can now be implemented in a way that users only share more personal content using them with the people they trust most.</p>
<p>As Instagram has continued to iterate on its Stories feature, new options have been made available. <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/11/30/share-with-your-close-friends-on-instagram-stories/" rel="nofollow">As announced on the official Instagram blog</a>, users can now set a new flag on friends to make them &quot;close friends.&quot; These close friends cannot be viewed as such on your profile, and no one can request to be a close friend either, leaving the choice to be entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Starting today, users that share Stories can set it so each Story is shared with either all of their followers or just the users they've labelled as close friends. This feature is now available worldwide on Instagram for both Android and iOS, with instructions on how to share a Story with only close friends located on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/2183694401643300" rel="nofollow">the official Instagram Help Center</a>.</p>
