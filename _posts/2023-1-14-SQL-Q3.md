## SQL Practice Problems (3)

Today, I solved more practice problems for SQL on school.programmers.co.kr, and  
I will be going over some of the questions that I did that I needed some time to research or think in order to solve.

### Finding the flavors of ice cream with more total orders
```
first_half
+-------------------------------------+
|Column name |   Type     |  Nullable |
+-------------------------------------+
|SHIPMENT_ID | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
|FLAVOR	     | VARCHAR(N) |   FALSE   |
|TOTAL_ORDER | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
+-------------------------------------+

july
+-------------------------------------+
|Column name |   Type     |  Nullable |
+-------------------------------------+
|SHIPMENT_ID | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
|FLAVOR	     | VARCHAR(N) |   FALSE   |
|TOTAL_ORDER | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
+-------------------------------------+

first_half and july tables have the same kinds of data.
first_half represents the data of the sold ice cream in the first half of the year,
and july represents the data of the sold ice cream in July.

In july table, same flavor is made from two different factories due to the amount of order,
so the flavor is same, but might have different shipment_id.

Query the 3 flavors that has the most total_order when the total order of first_half and july is added
in decreasing order of the added total_order.
```

My First Attempt:
```sql
SELECT jul.flavor
FROM july AS jul
    INNER JOIN first_half AS fh ON jul.shipment_id = fh.shipment_id
GROUP BY jul.flavor
ORDER BY SUM(jul.total_order) + SUM(fh.total_order) DESC
LIMIT 3
```
I was really confused when I got the problem wrong because I did not know what I got wrong on. 
So I looked at the problems more carefully, and I noticed that same flavors with different id exist in the july table.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT jul.flavor
FROM july AS jul
    LEFT JOIN first_half AS fh ON jul.shipment_id = fh.shipment_id
GROUP BY jul.flavor
ORDER BY SUM(jul.total_order) + SUM(fh.total_order) DESC
LIMIT 3
```
I used left join to join all of the data including the overlapping flavors in july.

### Categorizing short-term and long-term rentals
```
car_rental_company_rental_history
+-------------------------------------+
|Column name |   Type     |  Nullable |
+-------------------------------------+
|HISTORY_ID  | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
|CAR_ID	     | INTEGER    |   FALSE   |
|START_DATE  | DATE       |   FALSE   |
|END_DATE    | DATE       |   FALSE   |
+-------------------------------------+

HISTORY_ID: rental history id
CAR_ID: car id
START_DATE: date rented
END_DATE: date returned

From car_rental_company_rental_history, add the column 'rent_type' that categorizes the rent as
long-term if rented the car for 30 days or more, and short-term if rented the car for less than
30 days. Order the data by rental history id.
```

My First Attempt:
```sql
SELECT history_id
     , car_id
     , DATE_FORMAT(start_date, "%Y-%m-%d") AS start_date
     , DATE_FORMAT(end_date, "%Y-%m-%d") AS end_date
     , CASE
           WHEN end_date >= DATE_ADD(start_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY) THEN "long-term"
           ELSE "short-term"
       END AS rent_type
FROM car_rental_company_rental_history
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2022-09-01' AND '2022-09-30'
ORDER BY history_id DESC
```
I got wrong because of the concept of the date. The day a person rented the car counts as the first day, 
so if I add 30 days, that would categorize long-term rent from 31 days or more.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT history_id
     , car_id
     , DATE_FORMAT(start_date, "%Y-%m-%d") AS start_date
     , DATE_FORMAT(end_date, "%Y-%m-%d") AS end_date
     , CASE
           WHEN end_date >= DATE_ADD(start_date, INTERVAL 29 DAY) THEN "long-term"
           ELSE "short-term"
       END AS rent_type
FROM car_rental_company_rental_history
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2022-09-01' AND '2022-09-30'
ORDER BY history_id DESC
```

For these types of questions, I noticed that I not only need to write the code well in SQL, 
but also need to understand the data very well. I got wrong on these two questions because 
I did not fully understand the data types and concepts. I get the grip of writing the codes, 
so I need to work more on fully understanding those elements.
