<p><p>In the wake of recent privacy controversies involving Facebook and other major companies, steps to give users more control over their data have become very commonplace. This has only increased with the enactment of GDPR. That being said, some companies have been relatively slow to adopt giving users more granular data control, including Google. This will now change.</p>
<p>Announced by Eric Miraglia, Google's Director of Product Management for Privacy at the company's Data Protection Office <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-it-easier-control-your-data-directly-google-products/" rel="nofollow">on its official blog</a>, Google has further refined its new Google Account controls that were originally introduced earlier this year. Users can now access and delete their search activity directly from Google.com (with a link to the company's <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/privacyadvisor/search" rel="nofollow">personalized data privacy advisor</a>). In addition, users can also control what information is saved to your account and what kinds of ads you see (as well as to what degree personalization based on search data and cross-site tracking impacts them).</p>
<p>Starting today, Google Account holders will be able to access more detailed information on their <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-search/'><img alt='Small Google Search icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-search_84813.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Search</a> history from both their desktops and the mobile web. This will be expanded to the <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a> and <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_88776.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a> apps &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot; This additional detail and control will be expanded to <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/google-maps/'><img alt='Small Google Maps icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/google-maps_72611.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Google Maps</a> in 2019, with &quot;many other Google products&quot; to follow.</p>
