### Images
{% include figure image_path="/assets/unsplash-gallery-image-3.jpg" alt="Alt text" caption="Caption text" %}

![image-left](/assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-1.jpg){: .align-left}
The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap 
around the 150Ã—150 image, which is left aligned. There should be plenty of room 
above, below, and to the right of the image.
