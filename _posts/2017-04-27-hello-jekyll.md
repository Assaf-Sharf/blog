# Links
[Link Text](http://kramdown.gettalong.org "Kramdown")

# Horizontal Rule
This is a long paragraph that keeps going and going and going.
Use two backslashes \\
for hard line break
* * * 
Here's another paragraph

And a new paragraph

# Code snippet
```
def what?
    42

```

Use backticks for `inline code`.

# Images

![image-left](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left}
The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap 
around the 150Ã—150 image, which is left aligned. There should be plenty of room 
above, below, and to the right of the image.
