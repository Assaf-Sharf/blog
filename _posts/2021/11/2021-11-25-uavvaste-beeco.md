Last week, Bartosz and Mateusz participated [Be Eco with Us 2021 conference](https://beecowithus.usz.edu.pl/work/konferencja/). Be Eco with Us is an international scientific conference on ecology and nature protection held at the University of Szczecin.

## Topics

During the conference, the participants listened to lectures on green technology. The opening lecture was given by Pasquale Policastro, Ph. D. Prof. US on the topic "Life in symbiosis with the biosphere: A major challenge for humanity in the 21st century". You could discover a device that takes air samples from the atmosphere and surveys on eco-friendly accounting. The vast majority of the program was covered by presentations about the production of biomaterials and the recycling of plastics.

Bartosz and Mateusz presented their UAVVaste project, which uses drones to detect litter in the natural environment and reports it to a database. They talked about how the dataset and algorithm were built and then demonstrated how they developed a prototype of the device. The prototype also enabled them to win 3rd place at the international technology competition Teknofest 2021, Turkey in the UAV free mission category.
