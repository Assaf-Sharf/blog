## EKOinnowatorzy contest

[EKOinnowatorzy](https://www.instytutze.org/ekoinnowatorzy/) is a national competition for students and academic initiatives related to innovative and ecologic projects. The contest aims to promote, develop and reward the best ideas in several specified categories. In 2021 rules assume three main award classes: project, student scientific club, and individuality. Moreover, the jury gave seven special prizes. The UAVVaste project represented in the final pitch deck by Jan Dominiak and Mateusz Piechocki won the Innovation Technology prize.
