_Before reading..._

*   _Target Audience:_ Technical writers in the software industry.
*   _Scenario:_ A technical writer is beginning a new project, creating
    or updating documentation for a feature. They are preparing for
    the project, understanding the work, its scope, finding the subject
    matter experts, defining the stages of the work, and estimating the
    amount of time for each stage to be completed.
*   _Sources:_ I reviewed 3-6 internal document plan templates, pulling
    elements and ideas from some, then combining those with my own
    experiences and what I found helpful.

_...and here's the doc plan._

Created a widely used doc plan template for the Cloud writing community
that was reviewed and recommended by several senior writers.
