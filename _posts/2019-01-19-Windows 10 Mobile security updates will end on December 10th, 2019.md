<p><p>Microsoft has announced that all support for Windows 10 Mobile will end on December 10th, 2019.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2018/2/microsoft-discontinuing-support-for-multiple-windows-phone-7-and-8-features" rel="nofollow">the discontinuation of Windows Phone 7.5 and 8 last year</a>, the end of support for Windows 10 Mobile has been expected for some time. Feature updates for the mobile operating system have been discontinued for some time, which Microsoft itself admitted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead" rel="nofollow">back in October of 2017</a>.</p>
<p>In the company's <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4485197/windows-10-mobile-end-of-support-faq" rel="nofollow">End of Support FAQ</a> for the mobile OS, Microsoft recommends that users &quot;move to a supported <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/android/'><img alt='Small Android icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/android_84815.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />Android</a> or <a href='//alternativeto.net/software/ios/'><img alt='Small iOS icon' class='mini-app-icon' src='//d2.alternativeto.net/dist/icons/ios_88776.png?width=36&height=36&mode=crop&upscale=false' />iOS</a> device.&quot;</p>
<p>Device backups containing settings and app data can still be made until March 10th, 2020. After that point, users will have to migrate their settings and miscellaneous data by manual data entry where they can; otherwise, they'll have to start over. Microsoft listed the following steps to make a backup before then:<br />
Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security -&gt; Backup -&gt; More Options, and then tap &quot;Back up now&quot;</p>
