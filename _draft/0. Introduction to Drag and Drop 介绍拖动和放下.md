# 0. Introduction to Drag and Drop 介绍拖动和放下

https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/DragandDrop.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000069-SW1

Cocoa gives you the ability to implement sophisticated drag-and-drop capabilities both within your application and between applications. This programming topic describes how you can implement drag-and-drop with just a few methods.

Cocoa提供了复杂的拖动操作，包括应用内的拖放，跨应用的拖放。本篇编程话题描述了如何实现它们。

In the text here and in the dragging protocol descriptions, the term dragging session is the entire process during which an image is selected, dragged, released, and absorbed or rejected by the destination. A dragging operation is the action that the destination takes in absorbing the image when it is released. The dragging source is the object that “owns” the image that is being dragged; it is specified as an argument to the method that instigates the dragging session.

拖动会话，意思是图片被选中，图动，释放，吸收，或者被目地拒绝的整个过程。
放下操作，是当图片释放的时候，目的地接收图片的动作。（原文有误吧，吸收怎么会是拖动操作）
拖动来源，“拥有”被拖动图片的对象；它被指定为发起拖动会话的方法的一个参数。

Dragging is a visual phenomenon. To be the source or destination of a dragging operation, an object must represent a portion of screen real estate; thus, only window and view objects can be the sources and destinations of drags. (Note that the source view is not necessarily the same objects as the dragging source defined above.) NSWindow and NSView provide methods that handle the user interface for dragging an object. You only need to implement a few methods from either the NSDraggingSource or NSDraggingDestination protocol, depending on whether your window or view subclass is the source or destination.

拖动是一种视觉现象。要成为一个拖动操作的源头或者目的地，对象必须在屏幕上占有一定部分；因此，只有窗口和视图对象可以称为拖动的来源和目的地。（注意：源视图并不一定是前面定义的拖动源。）NSWindow和NSView提供了处理拖动对象的用户接口的方法。

你只需要实现少量方法，要么来自NSDraggingSource，要么来自NSDraggingDestination，取决于你的窗口或视图子类，是拖动来源还是拖动目的地。
