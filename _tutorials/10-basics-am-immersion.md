`World immersion.`

The most important rule when creating immersion is:

- closed [AM{World}](/tutorials/basics-am-world-and-form).

Failure to comply with this rule is tantamount to non-compliance with the definition of [artificial mind](/tutorials/basics-am-basics).

The openness of the [AM{World}](/tutorials/basics-am-world-and-form), is synonymous with the possibility of penetrating [AM{World}](/tutorials/basics-am-world-and-form).

The [AM{Observer}](/tutorials/basics-term-observer) cannot see minds from other [AM{World}](/tutorials/basics-am-world-and-form).
