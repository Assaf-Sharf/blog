`Introduction to artificial intelligence and artificial mind.`

## Short and concise definitions with limited explain

In this chapter I will use short and concise definitions with very limited explain of the logic behind it. Too extensive explanation of issues, would enter into th areas of study of the human mind.

## Programming knowledge

You need to know basics of:

- javascript
- how simple games and applications works
- how simple client-server works
