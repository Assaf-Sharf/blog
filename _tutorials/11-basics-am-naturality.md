`World's naturality.`

The most important elements of **AM{Naturality}** are:

- principles

Everything in the [**AM{World}**](/tutorials/basics-am-world-and-form) exists according to the principles, for example:

- existence of the object
- interaction between objects

The principles literally define everything and can be in the form of, for example:

- mechanics
- law
- logic

The [**AM{Observer}**](/tutorials/basics-term-observer) does not have to know all the principles. But if at a given moment he does not know the principle that would explain the effect of interactions, then he will lose the sense of naturalness.
