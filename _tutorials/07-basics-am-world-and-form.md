`The birth of mind.`

Theres no any restrictions to define **AM{World}** and **AM{Form}**.

For programmers the easiest way to understand these is compare **AM{World}** to game world and **AM{Form}** to NPC.

## Examples

- Game - mmorpg:
  - **AM{World}** whole game world
  - **AM{Form}** could be any NPC with AI
- Game - chess:
  - **AM{World}** is chessboard
  - **AM{Form}** could be oponent as NPC with AI
