`The Basics.`

## Types

- Machine AI
- Human AI

## Machine AI

Something has machine AI when it is able to make a choice, according to the [AM{Observer}](/tutorials/basics-term-observer/).

## Human AI

Something has human AI when it makes the right choices, according to the [AM{Observer}](/tutorials/basics-term-observer/).

## Example of machine AI

```javascript
function fun(number) {
  if (number > 0) console.log("greater than zero");
  else if (number < 0) console.log("less than zero");
  else console.log("is zero");
```

[AM{Observer}](/tutorials/basics-term-observer/) consider that function has AI, because make choice while compare number to zero.

## Example of human AI

```javascript
console.log("Hello");
```

> If You completely don't understand it, do not worry. To understand that is necessary knowledge about artificial mind (AM) from the further chapters.

[AM{Observer}](/tutorials/basics-term-observer/) consider that it's correct.

> In the above sentence I intentionally didn't use word "choice", because the meaning of word "choice" in human AI have completely different meaning then machine "choice".
