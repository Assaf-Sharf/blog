    "It is also worth mentioning that the the built-in function `round()` is used to round off the final price of the ticket before it is returned. This is because multiplying the ticket price by the discount will result in a `float` that could have more than 2 digits after the decimal point. Since movie ticket prices are listed in currencies, which are typically displayed as real positive numbers with two decimal places, we should round off the answer. This is what the built-in function `round` does, which takes in two arguments. The first argument is the number we want to round (in this case `ticket_price`), while the second argument is the number of decimal places we want to round to (in this case it is `2`)."
