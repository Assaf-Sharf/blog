    "Create a function called `name_and_birth_year` which has two parameters `name` (of type `str`) and `age` (of type `int`). This function should calculate and return the name and year in which a person was born, assuming that the current year is **2022**. Additionally, the value returned by the function should be a `str` in the following format: `'{name} was born in {birth_year}'`.\n",

    "So if we run the code `name_and_birth_year('Mary', 28)` we will get the result: `'Mary was born in 1994'`\n",
