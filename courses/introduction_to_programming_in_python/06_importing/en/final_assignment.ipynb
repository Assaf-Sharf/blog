    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write all the necessary pieces of code to create the game of Yahtzee in Python. More specifically, you will define the following three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `roll_dice()` - this function will simulate rolling the dice, given the possibility to roll up to 5 dice.\n",
    "2. `convert_user_input_to_dice_indices()` - this function will convert data from a user-friendly format to a programming-friendly format.\n",
    "3. `calculate_score()` - this function will calculate the score, given the final state of all of the dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you define all three functions, you can run the last code cell in this notebook (which was prepared for you) to launch and play the game of Yahtzee. However, the program written in the last code cell depends on the aforementioned three functions working correctly - it will not work until you have defined those functions correctly."

On the second and third turns, the player has the option to choose which dice they want to roll again, and which dice they want to leave. If during the first or second turn the player is happy with the result on all of the dice, they may choose to skip the remaining turns. \n",

    "1. Comments - the code below contains comments which describe what is happening in the program. A comment begins with a `#` and is followed by plain English. Python ignores everything written after a `#`, so it won't affect our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `input()` function, which halts the execution of a program and waits for the user to type in some text and press enter. This allows the user to input some information into the program. This is how we can get the user's choice regarding which dice to roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Strings defined on multiple lines - when you want to create a really long string, defining it over multiple lines can help with readability, as opposed to having one really long line. Using the `\\` allows us to continue Python code onto the next line, while Python treats this code as part of the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with the code below - change some things around and don't worry about breaking the program. If you feel particularly adventurous, you can try to improve the program by adding functionality. For example, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. add the option to play against another user (taking turns) \n",
    "2. add score tracking across multiple rounds\n",
    "3. add an error prevention system if the user inputs an invalid string (writing the wrong thing will break the program currently)\n",
    "4. you could implement the entirety of the original rules of Yahtzee\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have made it this far in the course, you have all the necessary tools to create such a program! Of course you are still at the beginning of your programming journey, so don't worry if you are having a hard time with some things - it is absolutely normal. It is a good idea to ask questions and look for answers in the right places (there are many good resources online) - this way you will surely improve quickly."
