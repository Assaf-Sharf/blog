EX. 10 (1 point)
Code a function `is_word(string)`, which will check if the provided `string` is a word. 
Your aim is to write a function with the aid of regular expressions, which is to check if 
there is no space in the `string`, so it must be a word('This is a word!') or in case space ('This is not a word!').
