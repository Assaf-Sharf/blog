Imagine that you are working with some software which is doing some repeatable operations. 
For example, let it be an ATM machine, which is checking if the card is ok, then asks for 
the PIN code and in the end asks for the amount to withdraw. Probably such an operation in 
a data base looks like this `transaction_nr ='card_number, PIN_code, amount_to_withdraw'`, 
where `transaction_nr` is a string. Your task is to code a function `how_much(transaction_nr)` 
which will return the `money_to_withdraw` equal to `amount_to_withdraw`. Probably the `.split()` 
method might be useful.
