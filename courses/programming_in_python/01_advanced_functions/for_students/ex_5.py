The (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is one of the most popular examples of an approximation 
of the golden spiral. You have probably heard about this in your high school. Your task is to write 
a `fib(n)` function, where `n` is a parameter provided that indicates the number of the desired term 
of the Fibonacci sequence. Also, you have to count all the functions calls. This function returns tuple with two values:
1st - the Fibonacci number, and 2nd is the number of function calls. The mathematical formulas for this sequence are as follows:

$F_{0} = 0, F_{1} = 1$

and
    
$F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n > 1$

Sample `fib(n)` call:

>>>fib(6)
output:
>>>(8, 13)
