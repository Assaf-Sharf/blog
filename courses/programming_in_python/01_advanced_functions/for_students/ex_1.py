EX. 1  (1 point)
Your task is to create a `factorial_recursive (x) ` function that calculates the factorial
(https://www.britannica.com/science/factorial) of the number provided in a recurrence manner.
As an example, you should use the `factorial_iterative(x)` which is also calculating the factorial
of provided number but in for loop.

#SAMPLE ITERATIVE SOLUTION
def factorial_iterative(x):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, x + 1): result *= i
    return result
