  description: "Most of my work has been done when working and is therefore copyrighted. Here are the few examples
  of projects I am working on or have contributed to"

- project:
  title: London Volleyball Association
  link: "https://github.com/troccoli/lva"
  tagline: "This project started as an attempt to write a more modern site for the LVA League Admins in Laravel.
  It is now a sort of showroom project for my Laravel and soon VueJs skills."
- project:
  title: iCal
  link: "https://github.com/troccoli/iCal"
  tagline: "A fork of the original markuspoerschke/iCal repo, to which I contributed."
- project:
  title: Laravel Framework
  link: "https://github.com/troccoli/framework"
  tagline: "This is a fork of the original laravel/framework repo. I used it to work on a couple of PRs I submitted
  (and were accepted)."
- project:
  title: Docker image
  link: "https://github.com/troccoli/docker-laravel"
  tagline: "This repository contains the Dockerfile I used to create an image I want to use in my projects (currently
  only on the London Volleyball Association one). The idea of the project is to give me a consistent and reliable
  development environment without the need to download any tools, apart from Docker."
- project:
  title: GitLab Deployments Status
  link: "https://github.com/troccoli/gitlab-deployments-status"
  tagline: "On one of my jobs I had the need to quickly find out which branch was deployed last to one of our client.
  And since I wanted to get some experience with VueJS and Vuetify, this seemed a good opportunity to do just that.
  It's a SPA which allows the user first select the GitLab project they are interested in, then a searchable table
  of all the environments for that project is displayed. Finally the user can see the details of the last deployment
  in any of the environments."
