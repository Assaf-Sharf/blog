  details: "
My main job still remains a development job, but I took an interest in the processes more than the code and I was
able to pursue it.
<br/>
I have helped the Scrum Master setting up meetings, making sure we stay focused on the agenda and have actionable items
at the end. This sparked my interest in Scrum Mastery.
<br/>
In the past six months, I have been involved in the reshaping of our Support team and processes, which I enjoyed.
In my capacity as "Product Owner", I was able to
<ul>
<li>rationalise the way tickets were traiged, refined and worked on</li>
<li>plan and manage the weekly Sprint and set goals for it</li>
<li>make better use of our client's UAT, by making sure one ticket was test at a time</li>
<li>be involved in high-level overview and planning of clients' projects</li>
</ul>
As such we are currently reviewing the aim of having a dedicated Support team, the type of tickets to assign to
it, rather than to one of the existing teams, the composition of such a team, etc.
In my role as PHP developer I
<ul>
<li>instigated a project to brand all emails, for uniformity of style and look&feel</li>
<li>was involved in enforcing code-design standards to and test coverage</li>
<li>built a middleware to import data from a third-party HR system into our core Product, using our own and 3rd party APIs</li>
</ul>"
