Hi I'm Matt - a python devloper, and budding data scientist currnetly based out of Raleigh, NC.

Although my undergraduate background is rooted in Biology, I fell in love with analytics and programming after graduation.

As a Marketing Scientist at Valassis Digital, I build and maintain databases (Hive and Postgres), develop code to streamline workflows across teams, and use analytics to measure the performance of digital marketing campaigns.

I also sometimes do stuff outside of work, including but not limited to...
* Cooking : What can I say ... I like food, so naturally I gravitated toward making it myself
* Working Out : I've consistenly worked out since I finished college - mostly, for the health benefits, but I also love the experimentation involved.
* Traveling : Life gets dull without a little bit of adventure. So far I've been to Canada, Honduras, India, Thailand, China, Hong Kong,
and Malaysia. Hoping to keep adding to the list!
* Reading : I've always been fascinated with how writers use of syntax and structure to manipulate the reader. I particular like Murukami, and Philip K. Dick - anything that feels like a waking dream really
* Movies : A natural extension of my love of literature. I love analyzing how the various elements come together to form a cohesive story. _In Bruges_, _Looper_, and _The Prestige_ are some of my favorites.
* RPGS : I'm a sucker for a good optimization problem. I enjoy the Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and Diablo games.
