title:  "Welcome to Lazarski Open Courses site!"
---

The site contains open courses offered by Lazarski University. At the top of the page, you can choose if you are interested in courses in English or Polish. Video materials were also published for all the subjects and are available on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ_yH3fxIAPy47blk3GxN6w). But we recommend you to study materials on this site since here you can find much more information than on YouTube. Our video materials are always attached after a necessary introduction to a particular topic.

We hope you like all of them! Good luck.
