We believe big ideas come from fresh viewpoints. Graduate and undergraduate students alike are valued members of UChicago research teams.  The Center for Data Intensive Science provides opportunities for collaboration with students in big data research, networking, programming, and user services.

### Open Science Data Cloud PIRE program

The Center for Data Intensive Science has summer fellowships supported by the NSF Partnerships for International Research and Education program open for grad students and other academics interested in data intensive science and cloud computing with the Open Science Data Cloud, a petabyte scale scientific computing cloud.
The program involves a one week workshop in Amsterdam followed by travel to a collaborating University to work on a summer research project.  
<br>
The deadline for applications for summer 2015 is March 31, 2015 (but reviewed on a rolling basis).  More information can be found at [pire.opensciencedatacloud.org](http://pire.opensciencedatacloud.org/).
