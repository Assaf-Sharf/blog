# Open Mic Workflow

## What is Open Mic:

Open Mic session is an activity going on approximately every other week. A KBSS team member or a guest presents an
interesting topic to the rest of the team and anyone willing to listen.

## Open Mic Structure

It consists of two posts:

- [Open Mic Announcement](_drafts/open-mic-announcement-template.markdown): includes when and where the next open mic
  session will take place.
  - It should be published around two weeks before the session
  - We should update the topic of the session at least 3 days before the session
- [Open Mic Session](_drafts/open-mic-session-template.markdown): includes the session materials (video and
  presentation)

### How To Create The Posts:

There are two templates, one for [sessions](_drafts/open-mic-session-template.markdown) and one
for [announcements](_drafts/open-mic-announcement-template.markdown). Templates are located in the `_drafts` folder and
contain instructions:

- CREATE A COPY TO THE _POSTS FOLDER AND RENAME IT TO [date]-[name].markdown and then follow instructions in it how it
  shall look like. Use the current date for the file name, otherwise it will not be displayed.
- Create new post both for announcement and past session.
- Create a **PULL REQUEST** and send it for **REVIEW** and **MERGE**

### Where Can I Find The Open Mic Session Link

- KBSS calendar: includes info  **where** and **when** the session takes place
- KBSS website: it should contain a public link to join the session
