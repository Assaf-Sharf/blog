# Open Mic Workflow
## What is open Mic:
Open mic session is an activity going on irregularly every other week.
A KBSS team member or a guest presents an interesting topic to the rest of the team and anyone willing to listen.
## Open Mic Structure
It consists of two posts:
- [Open Mic Announcement](_drafts/open-mic-announcement-template.markdown): includes when and where the next open mic session will take place. 
  - it should be published around two weeks before the session
  - We should update the topic of the session at least 3 days before the session
- [Open Mic session](_drafts/open-mic-session-template.markdown): includes the session materials (video and presentation)
### How To Create The Posts:
There are two templates, one for sessions and one for announcements.
Templates are located in the folder _draft and contain instructions:
- CREATE A COPY TO THE _POSTS FOLDER AND RENAME IT TO [date]-[name].markdown and then follow instructions in it how it shall look like.
-  Create new post both for announcement and past session.
-  Create **PULL REQUEST** and send it for **REVIEW** and **MERGE**
