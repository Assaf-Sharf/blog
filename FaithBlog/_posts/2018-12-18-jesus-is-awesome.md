title: "Why Jesus is awesome"

Recently I've been reading through the book of Hebrews. As I've been reading through I've noticed that the main idea is something like, "Jesus is awesome, and here's why".

I realised that this would be an excellent topic for a blog. As a Christian I don't give Jesus enough credit. That is, I often forget how amazing it is to be a Christian, and I focus on the things in my life that I don't like, rather than the wonder of knowing Jesus. So this blog (or at least the first few posts) are an attempt to capture what Hebrews teaches me about Jesus and why he is so awesome.

The main aim of this will be to try to collect my thoughts on what I'm reading in the hope that some of it will stick in my brain. If this is helpful for others then that's great too!

See you in the next one ...
