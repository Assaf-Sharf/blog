I am a developer who values human interaction above code-style perfection. I am in love with reactive backend development using Scala. On the client side, my biggest expertise is native Android development, but I have a kind interest in web development too (React.js is a lovely thing).

Beside software development, one of my biggest passion is touring with my bicycle: I regularly go for long distance trips and am the organizer of Bicycle Touring Amsterdam, a meetup with 200+ members, that I built with the intent of creating a community around the topic.
