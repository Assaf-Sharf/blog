I'm Pedro Piñera Buendía, Electronic & Communication Engineer and Mobile Developer currently working on Redbooth. I've been working with mobile technologies from 2010 when I started developing apps for iOS, since then I've relesed applications such as **Solare** to help people to protect them from the sun, **yonkiPOPS**, an app that offers film recommendations to the users, **Movi time** to let you know about the cinemas in your area and their schedules, ...

The summer of 2013 I joined **Redbooth** as iOS Developer and I've been improving my skills there focusing in aspects like API interactions, integrations, data persistence or view management amongst other. I've been helping the Redbooth **Android** team too and I learnt then the fundamentals of Android development. Moreover I've learnt about **Ruby** implementing some libraries and controllers with it.

During these years I've worked in different Open Source projects in different languages. All of them are published in Github with their respective documentation, tests, an support through issues.

## Open Source projects
### iOS
- **PPiAwesomeButton:** UIButton category with new methods to setup a button with text + FontAwesome Icon. Open App. https://github.com/pepibumur/PPiAwesomeButton
- **PPiFlatSegmentedControl:** PPiFlatSegmentedControl is an UI Control developed avoiding original UISegmentedControl to get interesting features related with the flat design. For better appearance you can add Font Awesome library to your project and use their icons into the Segmented Control. https://github.com/pepibumur/PPiFlatSegmentedControl
- **MagicMP:** I noticed that the new MultiPeer framework introduced in iOS 7 was segmented in two main components and still using delegates. The framework has an abstraction layer in viewController format to explore nearby users, or advertiser devices, but.. What if we don't want to implement the module using viewControllers? Here's where MagicMP appears, it unifies both components in an easy way, with blocks and a singleton class, use whenever you want without depending on a ViewController. https://github.com/pepibumur/MagicMP.
- **PPiShowtime-Google-iOS-Library:** Get showtimes from any City thanks to Google Showtime. I discovered there was no option to access to this information so I decided to parse the information directly from their Website. As iOS Developer I thought it would be useful to release a Objective-C class to get/parse this information for all developers. I called it PPiShowtime. https://github.com/pepibumur/PPiShowtime-Google-iOS-Library
- **SugarRecord:** SugarRecord is a management library to make it easier work with CoreData and REALM. Thanks to SugarRecord you'll be able to start working with CoreData/REALM with just a few lines of code. https://github.com/SugarRecord/SugarRecord

### Android
- **EditTextMentions:** EditText subclass with mentions detection (like Facebook or Twitter). https://github.com/pepibumur/EditTextMentions.
- **Emojize:** Emojize is a Java library to convert keyboard emojis to chearsheet emojis. https://github.com/pepibumur/emojize.

### Python
- **Pushpy:** Pushpy is a push notification server based on Python. It's composed by a users database to store users token ( and more information that the server owner wants ), a web interface with Google Login to send notifications using a web platform. The Google emails accounts allowed to send notifications are stored in another database. https://github.com/pepibumur/PushPy
