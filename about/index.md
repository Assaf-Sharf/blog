Oh, hey, I'm Balint Neray - yet an other wordprocessin' and data-cruchin' sociologist - You are visiting my site right now.
<br><br>
*Viewer discretion is advised:* this site is most likely going to be filled with strongly self-centred posts. Rather uncharacteristic, as I’d like to believe. And rather surprising too. Even for myself. When I left Hungary I told myself as well as some friends and relatives that I am not going to leak out my thoughts and ideas. Seriously, just because I moved to an other country (even if this country is the US) my thoughts are not worthy of mentioning. Indeed, so far nothing has changed.
<br><br>
So what are the reasons for getting self-centred? Almost two months have past since I arrived not only to the US but to Durham. The initial exaggerated excitement is slowly over (as it was expected). And since I eventually spend so much time in fornt of my computer, I could really afford to spend some reporting about myself for those who care. Fortunately there are some who do so … so we shall see how far I can get.
<br><br>
I wouldn’t say it is going to be blogging (whatever that is) as I haven't really thought about the thematic structure of the future posts. But second of all I take this need for self-centred reports as an opportunity to start writing about topics that might be interesting for a somewhat wider audience. And if it will be so, this intro shall be revised ...
