I am a developer who values human interaction above code-style perfection. I am in love with reactive backend development using Scala. On the client side, my biggest expertise is native Android development, but I have a kind interest in web development too (React.js is a lovely thing).

I am the organizer of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Reactive-Amsterdam/">Reactive Amsterdam</a> meetup. I love the Reactive idea - in all of its form - and I make it part of my everyday work.

Beside software development, one of my biggest passion is touring with my bicycle: I regularly go for long distance trips and am the organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bicycle-Touring-Amsterdam/">Bicycle Touring Amsterdam</a>, a meetup that I started in order to grow a community around the topic.
