I'm Pedro Piñera Buendía, Electronic & Communication Engineer and Mobile Developer currently working on Redbooth. I've been working with mobile technologies from 2010 when I started developing apps for iOS, since then I've relesed applications such as **Solare** to help people to protect them from the sun, **yonkiPOPS**, an app that offers film recommendations to the users, **Movi time** to let you know about the cinemas in your area and their schedules, ...

The summer of 2013 I joined **Redbooth** as iOS Developer and I've been improving my skills there focusing in aspects like API interactions, integrations, data persistence or view management amongst other. I've been helping the Redbooth **Android** team too and I learnt then the fundamentals of Android development. Moreover I've learnt about **Ruby** implementing some libraries and controllers with it.
