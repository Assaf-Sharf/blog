I am a developer who values human interaction above code-style perfection. I love Reactive Development with Scala and, on the client side, native Android development. I have a keen interest in web development.

I run the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Reactive-Amsterdam/">Reactive Amsterdam</a> meetup. I love Reactive - in all of its form - and I make it part of my everyday work.

Beside software development, one of my biggest passion is touring with my bicycle: I regularly go for long distance trips and am the organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bicycle-Touring-Amsterdam/">Bicycle Touring Amsterdam</a>.

Do get in touch for anything related to

* Android or Scala freelance work
* bicycle touring
* fun videomaking (I'm a big GoPro fan)

An [email](mailto:fabio.europe@gmail.com) is the easiest way to start a rich conversation.
