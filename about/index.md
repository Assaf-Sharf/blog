A blog by two Data Scientists

## Matt Gregory

<!--With a PhD in Genetic Engineering fron the University of OxfordM

A capable and self-motivated data analyst with a background in the biological sciences and education. Iâ€™m keen to explore data and to use cutting-edge statistical techniques, including Machine Learning algorithms, to make reproducible, robust and actionable insights from the data.

I have recently completed a PhD in Genetic Engineering at the University of Oxford where I developed my penchant for Data Science.-->
