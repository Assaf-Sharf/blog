message: "Today, there is great news in the land. It \r\nis of several ex-governors and other high officials under one form of \r\ninterdiction or the other, for corruption. And the figures involved are frightening,\r\nthe least being billion and billions of naira. The wondrous matter is not whether these men are \r\npetty thieves or plain heroic saints. The matter is that we are in an era, where there are so many, big men and women, alleged to be stealing \r\nso much, in so little a time. Governance in Nigeria has literally become a hec­tic and unceasing crime scene.\r\n\r\nAnd even rescuers actually come in to join the robbery.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us for matters of simplicity concentrate on the cast of governors.\r\nToday, to be elected a governor in Nigeria and not end up a common thief, requires that one be \r\nsuperhuman, a divinity as it were. But no man ever became \r\ngod and still bore his human flesh. That is man cannot be both material \r\nand god.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, this is exactly what the constitution requires \r\nof elected governors. Thus, the image we have of these governors as \r\nthe guilty or likely to be guilty parties, is not exactly correct.\r\n\r\nWe can canvass their innocence before any properly constituted justice \r\nsystem in the world. It is the system that really lays this great men low.\r\nIt is the system that is cor­rupt and merely coopts the innocent into its \r\nrot and thievery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point is as follows. It is that the powers that have been gathered and given these governors are so much that no mortal can keep them and be saint­ly, \r\nor even sane. The constitution, apparently, in the enthusiasm to push for fast-paced national devel­opments gathered all extant and imaginable pow­ers and \r\nhanded those over to the governors. That is, these governors are for all practical purposes, \r\nelected as dictators over and above their states. And like all dictators,\r\nthese governors control more powers than gods and \r\nyet are mere mortals like the rest of us. This is the \r\nsource of all the problems of corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorruption in public office is in summary, the giving of omnipotent powers to mortal man. It is the stress of controlling omni-prevalent powers while remaining man, which is the source of sys­tem-pervasive corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is, in failing to be gods as they must, these governors scale up and morph into monsters.\r\nSo, it is not really that they are thieves by practice or birth.\r\nIt is that thievery is the only way to run the Nigerian system.\r\nIf you don’t steal in Nigerian gov­ernance, then you are not human. \r\nForget the ser­mons, this is the plain truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the monster with so much powers in him and thus, no need \r\nfor decency, no sense of culture and or civilization, naturally converts public property, including offices, into personal and family \r\nassets. Or simply, he is unable to distinguish the two.\r\nLat­er, he scales down to being a petty thief, the fruits of being made a monster.\r\nSo, it is not the ‘authority thievery’ \r\nwe should bother. We should stop them from being monsters.\r\nAll monsters are rogues. And all attempts to make a man a god makes a monster invariably.\r\nNorth Korea is ‘monsterism’ gone hay­wire, and Nigeria is on the \r\nmarch. Nigeria ronu.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, these governors are not particularly evil. They are normal persons like you and I.\r\nThus, who­ever else is put there with so much net powers to dispense, will in spite,\r\nof himself become a petty thief. That is, we must cure and heal ourselves of the error \r\nof thinking that Nigeria is gone so low in the quality of political personnel.\r\n\r\nIn fact, so many go to the extent of canvassing that we once had a golden era of men. \r\nAnd they list such names as Dr. M. I. Okpara, Sir \r\nAhmadu Bello and Chief Awolo­wo, etc. The point is that is \r\nconjectural and wrong. We can assure that if any and or \r\nall of these men were to be born in these times, they will, one and all, end up as petty thieves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the reason is simple and fundamental to hu­man nature.\r\n\r\nIt is that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\r\n\r\nCorruption is a power function and not a person nexus.\r\nWe are corrupt to the extent of net powers we wield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo to repeat, the question is what made corrup­tion go industrial with us lately.\r\nIf you sought an answer you will find it in the intervention of \r\nthe military. The military dictator and armed political robber despite his intentions or claims is the ag­gregator of power par excellence.\r\n\r\nThat is military governments are power concentrators and sole ‘ac­quisitors’.\r\nAll the dictator does whether he comes in as a thief in the night wearing \r\nmilitary fatigues or rigging vote counts, is to aggregate all the powers into a few \r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give a quick example. On the success of a coup, all powers judicial, legislative, executive and thievery powers, are concentrated in the Armed Forces Ruling \r\nCouncil or Supreme Military Coun­cil in a pyramid-style architecture.\r\n\r\nTherefore with or without intending it, the military government is in its every \r\nbeing and spite of itself, a cesspool of corruption, thanks to its power aggregation and constrictor instincts.\r\nThat is to be a military coup maker and or dictator is to be a \r\nconstrictor and gatherer of all powers. That makes you to be cor­rupt a \r\npriori, even before your every first act of be­traying your nation by taking up arms against her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the military is gone? Apparently. The truth however is that they are not done with us or even themselves as a political force and politicized and largely regionized army.\r\nThe point is that the mili­tary dictators left, but they left their shadows \r\nand body odors with us. Perhaps if the military dicta­tors had gone with their offensive body odors and penumbra shadows, all the \r\nworld would have been round and Nigeria in grace.\r\nBut trust rogue re­gimes, they left us a forged constitution. And that \r\nconstitution is patterned after Arab despotisms.\r\nAp­parently there is no word for democracy in Arabic language and worldview.\r\nMeanwhile there is no Arab country that is a democracy and Arabs are the only geo-polity in the world that \r\nhas no democracy. All Arabs do and have done in history is \r\nto aggre­gate and concentrate all powers in few hands and ultimately in one hand.\r\nAnd the authors and or forg­ers of the Nigerian constitution are all \r\nstooges of Arabist despotisms, as the way to progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the extant Nigerian constitution is a draw­down from Arabism.\r\nThat rag-sheet of a constitu­tion is deluded that \r\nit is dictatorship that develops a nation. Yet, no Arab nation is developed.\r\nSo, in imitation of Arabism, the governors are satraps, are like flag bearers \r\nto central dictator lording it over unpacified regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summary, corruption is native to the present constitution and the present constitution was born in corruption. That is why \r\nbeing governor and hold­ing political office in Nigeria is just as profitable as, only safer than robbing a bank.\r\nNigerian constitu­tion and or rogue constitution asks that elected of­ficials be god, have the rectitude of gods.\r\nPerhaps the constitution forgers did not know that the Arab court poetry that \r\nbeatified Arab leaders is praise po­etry and has no reality.\r\nIt is a magical thing. The true Arab poets are all in exile.\r\nThe resident Arab court poets sing: The office transforms the \r\nfool into a wise man, the thug into a king, thus consecrating \r\nthe pasts, the sordid pasts of the leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what is the cure to corruption in Nigeria?\r\nIt is to return the state to the people. Only the people in owning the state can and or \r\nmay protect it. The state is not the stolen treasure, a coup \r\nmaker makes it. If we allowed or habituated to the state as a stolen or hijacked treasure, then the stealing,\r\nthe scepter of the state as a robbery scene, an ongoing and never ending robbery scene, will \r\ngo on forever. Thus if we don’t return the stolen Nigerian state to the peo­ples, Nigeria \r\nwill remain literally a fallen elephant and all kinds of butchers, poachers, godogodos, thieves, governors and all, will be upon her.\r\nAnd it is moral. At least the extant constitutions says so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the devolution of power is not just a \r\nquestion of devolving power from the central government to the states.\r\nIt is more about the nature and distribu­tion of that power in states, LGAs and all.\r\n\r\nThe gov­ernors must be made increasingly powerless and the peoples \r\nincreasingly powerful. It is the people not government that \r\nare to be allowed to develop their nations, regions, states and LGAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea that one man, the governor is the de­veloper you need, is rooted in ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn fact democracy is the granting of the greatest powers to the greatest numbers.\r\nAmerica understood this like we made bare in our book, Corruption in Africa: Development through new Diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps a way out is to return to the parliamen­tary system.\r\n\r\nAnd if we don’t fix this wahala, we should come to terms that \r\nour people, whether as governors or civil servants are empowered to steal; \r\nthey don’t steal to be empowered. Today if you are a Nigerian governor and you are not \r\na thief, you should consult your babalawo, dey no born you well.\r\n\r\nOr in fact you are telling a lie."
