message: "Head for your bars first (open till 3am usually) as clubs never \r\nget started at weekends until well after 2 am, (and a few \"after hours\" keep working till after midday the very next day).\r\nSometimes local stores and eateries close on an hour or so \r\nduring hot afternoons.  Regarding the national scene, important stars like Chano Dominguez, Juan Perro, Tequila, \r\nDiego \"El Cigala\" or Tomatito could be seen."
