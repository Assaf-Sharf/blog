Thank you for improving this site! This site is open source and the API maintainers welcome your contributions. [Please reach out](/help/) if you have any questions.

## Content
The content of this site lives in the top-level directory `/docs` in the GitHub repo [netfoundry/mop-api-docs](https://github.com/netfoundry/mop-api-docs).

## Theme
The theme lives in the top-level `/` in the same GitHub repo [netfoundry/mop-api-docs](https://github.com/netfoundry/mop-api-docs) as the content.

## Preview
These steps provide a local preview server at **[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)**

1. Install
    1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), 
    2. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and 
    3. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. clone the repo 

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:netfoundry/mop-api-docs.git
    ```

3. switch to the content area `/docs` in the cloned working copy

    ```bash
    cd ./mop-api-docs/docs
    ```

4. execute

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build preview
    ```

5. **browse to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)**

6. Be aware that *search is not available* in the local preview.
7. Stop the preview container
    1. Focus the terminal where the container is running
    2. Send a `SIGTERM`, typically `Ctrl-c`
    
8. Alternatively, you could 
    1. run the preview container in the background
        
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build --detach preview
        ``` 

    2. and later stop the preview container

        ```bash
        docker-compose down --remove-orphans
        ```

## Things to Know

### Content &amp; Theme
* Local changes to files in `/docs` will be picked up immediately by Jekyll, except `/docs/_config.yml` which requires restarting the preview container.
* Optionally, before running the container, export your [GitHub API token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) as `JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN` and it will be made available to Jekyll for querying metadata from the GitHub API.
* Most content is in `/docs/_pages/` with meaningful names. You can add or edit Kramdown (GitHub-flavored Markdown) `.md` or Liquid template `.html` files.
* Theme changes could go in the top-level theme or become overrides in corresponding child directories under `/docs`. For example, `/docs/_layouts/default.html` overrides `/_layouts/default.html` and is available immediately in the local preview. Changes to the top-level theme don't become visible in the local preview until they're merged to the master branch in the Git remote. The idea is to minimize changes to the parent theme so that we can later merge in improvements from upstream.
* The theme is forked from Minimal Mistakes which publishes an excellent [quick-start guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) covering the use of the relevant Jekyll plugins.

### Build &amp; Publish
* All merges to the master branch are automatically published by GitHub pages.
* Merges to any branch trigger [a Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/github/netfoundry/mop-api-docs). The Travis build
    * validates the changes with Jekyll, and
    * updates the Algolia search index. The Travis env var `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` is the secret key for updating the Algolia index that was configured in `/docs/_config.yml`.
* The Travis job reports are sent to Slack in netfoundry.slack.com #dev-notifications
    * The Slack token is encrypted with `travis` CLI in `/.travis.yml` by following steps prescribed in [the Travis App for Slack](https://netfoundry.slack.com/apps/A0F81FP4N-travis-ci?next_id=0)
    ```bash
    # in /docs
    docker-compose run --rm build
    # iteractive in running container
    gem install travis --no-document
    travis encrypt "netfoundry:{redacted}" --add notifications.slack -r netfoundry/mop-api-docs
    ```
    The result of this is a new encrypted Slack token in `/.travis.yml` which you'll need to commit and push to Git remote.
* The domain name developer.netfoundry.io is a `CNAME` resource record in the netfoundry.io hosted zone in Route53. The `RDATA` of the record is the GitHub Pages sub-domain.
    ```bash
    ‚ùØ dig +short -tCNAME developer.netfoundry.io.
    netfoundry.github.io.
    ```
