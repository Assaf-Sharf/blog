NetFoundry is built on Ziti. Ziti is open-source software for building programmable, zero-trust networks. You can use Ziti "endpoints" with your NetFoundry network. For example, you can embed Ziti in your app with the endpoint SDK so it can participate in a NetFoundry network directly without any other software or gateways.

Visit the [Ziti web site](https://ziti.dev) to learn more about Ziti.
