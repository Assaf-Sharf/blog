RapidAPI provides SDKs for their ecosystem of APIs by proxy. You may click to subscribe to an API such as NetFoundry's and paste code snippets for your preferred language to quickly automate interactions with one or more APIs.

After you subscribe to NetFoundry through RapidAPI you'll use only RapidAPI's authentication guide and SDKs to connect to NetFoundry via RapidAPI. You won't need a separate identity or account with NetFoundry, but you can always become a customer directly if that suits you better at a later date.
