RapidAPI provides SDKs for their ecosystem of APIs. You may click to subscribe to an API such as NetFoundry's and paste code snippets they provide in your IDE to quickly automate interactions with one or more APIs.

After you subscribe to NetFoundry through RapidAPI you'll use only [RapidAPI's guides](https://docs.rapidapi.com/) to connect to NetFoundry via RapidAPI. You won't need a separate identity or account with NetFoundry, and you can always become a customer directly if that suits your case better at a later date.
