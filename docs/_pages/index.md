I'm a graduate student at [Texas A&M University](https://morpheuslab.engr.tamu.edu/), under the direction of [Dr. James Hubbard](https://stable.engr.tamu.edu/personnel/hubbard/) at the [Morpheus lab](https://morpheuslab.engr.tamu.edu/). I'm very interested in improving how humans and machines work together, especially in safety critical environments. Currently, we are exploring **quantum cognitive modeling** as a method to mitigate the autonomy conundrum. You can read more about this approach on this site [here](research.md) and [here](https://stable.engr.tamu.edu/human-cognition/). 

[My guitars](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAsEjP0q8ZPsUhmO26zzYUb5xDsCrT7Zy), [dairy based sweets]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-06-20-cheesecake %}), and [all things motorsport]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-20-MotoGP %}) keep me busy away from the lab, and I regularly support local programs focused on childrenâ€™s education. The ultimate dream is to leave the research community after 50 years of improving STEM inclusivity, and open my very theoretical bakery, *Yeast Common Denominator*. For now, I run this site as a way to improve my communication skills.
