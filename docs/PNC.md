# About the dataset: 
["The PNC includes a population-based sample of over 9500 individuals from the greater Philadelphia area, ages 8-21 years who received medical care at the CHOP network. The participants presented for diverse medical conditions, ranging from a well child visit and minor problems to chronic condition management to potentially life threatening health problems. They were not ascertained through psychiatric services.  They were initially enrolled in the genetic study at CHOPâ€™s Center for Applied Genomics (CAG). Upon assent/consent, participants were genotyped during the time of their clinical visit and provided written permission to be recontacted for studies of complex pediatric disorders. The PNC participants were selected at random after stratification by sex, age and ethnicity. The overall inclusion criteria included 1) ability to provide signed informed consent (parental consent was required for participants under age 18), 2) English language proficiency, and 3) physical and cognitive ability to participate in computerized clinical assessment and neurocognitive testing. All PNC participants were assessed neuropsychiatrically with a structured interview and completed the Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). A total of 1445 participants also received neuroimaging that included functional MRI (resting state and activated blood oxygenation-level dependent and perfusion measures with arterial spin labeling), structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)."](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/philadelphianeurodevelopmentalcohort.html)
