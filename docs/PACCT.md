# About the dataset: 
["This is an ongoing R01-funded, longitudinal, high-dimensional, multi-modal, phenotyping (neuroimaging, behavior, caregiver report, physiology) study of 350 school-aged children (5-12 years old) with heterogeneous exposures to early caregiving adversities (ECAs) that will prospectively assess neuro- behavioral development of the Negative Valence System and Cognitive Control System as defined by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Participants of the PACCT study and their parents/guardians participate in three in-lab sessions (every 15 months). The parents/guardians also complete a brief set of follow-up questionnaires via phone or online (7 months after each in-lab session)."](https://danlab.site.drupaldisttest.cc.columbia.edu/research/studies)
