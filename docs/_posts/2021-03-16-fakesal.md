## Introduction

FakeSal is a saliency algorithm that does stuff as reported in [FakeSal: A Fake Saliency Algorithm (2021)](https://arxiv.org/)

To get started using FakeSal, install fake-package
```bash
pip install fake-package
```

To enable FakeSal, adjust the `fake-config.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
algorithm: fakesal
```

## Key Highlights

When to use FakeSal
  * Don't need a black-box algorithm
  * Runtime performance is important
