This is the post content with inline code, (e.g. `<span style="color: red;">red</span>`. It should be displayed in place of the auto-generated excerpt in single-page views. Archive-index pages should display an auto-generated excerpt of this content.

Be sure to test the formatting of the auto-generated excerpt, to ensure that it doesn't create any layout problems.
