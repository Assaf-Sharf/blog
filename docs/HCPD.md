# About the dataset: 
["Childhood and adolescence are times of dramatic physical, emotional, social, and intellectual growth and change. Yet there is much we do not know about how normal development and childhood experiences (learning to read, playing a sport, or interacting socially) shape the brainâ€™s wiring. Thanks to recent technological advances pioneered by the foundational Human Connectome Project study of healthy young adults, we can now explore, in unprecedented detail, how the brain typically grows and connects during childhood and the transition through puberty to adolescence and young adulthood. Data collected will be shared broadly so that researchers can learn as much as possible from it for years to come/ Characterizing brain development in healthy kids will also allow us to better understand differences that can occur in children with conditions that may affect brain wiring such as early childhood adversity or autism. Ultimately, the HCP-D Study aims to collect information that parents, educators, and health professionals can use to enhance the well being of our children."](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-lifespan-development)
