## Natural Mortality Estimators
The natural mortality rate (*M*) of fish populations is one of the most important parameters for population dynamics and stock assessment models. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult parameters to estimate.  Direct estimates of *M* (e.g., from tagging studies) are usually difficult to obtain for most fish stocks.  Numerous methods have developed to obtain estimates of *M* from other more frequently available life history parameters.

This app, developed by [Jason Cope](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason_Cope), provides a straightforward method for obtaining the estimated value of *M* from a range of life-history based methods.
