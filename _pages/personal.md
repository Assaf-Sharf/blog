Here you can find a non-exhaustive list of projects that I pursue on my own. Feel free 
to reach out if you're interested in any of them.

## Pymicra

I created and developed the Python Tool for Micrometeorological Analyses:
[Pymicra](https://pymicra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is an open-source
project hosted on github that you can use of and contribute to.



## Ocean_cheatsheet

I started a quick [physical oceanography cheat sheet at
gitlab](https://gitlab.com/tomchor/ocean_cheatsheet/-/wikis/home) that lists and explains
some useful equations, relations, etc. in a very brief manner. I created it mainly for
personal use and it's still a work in progress that I populate as I need, but contributors
are welcome.



## Science communication

I am also interested in communicating science in general. Below is a video that I created
along with [TED-Ed](https://ed.ted.com/):

## Others

My other side projects can also be accessed using my [Github
page](https://github.com/tomchor). Most are for personal use but they are all open-source
and anyone can use them if they wish to.
