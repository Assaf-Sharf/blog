## [IoT meets Serverless](/assets/slides/iot_meets_serverless.pdf)
Speed and agility are the most expected in today’s analytics tools. The quicker you get from idea to insights, the more you can innovate & perform ad-hoc data analysis. I will be talking about how we can use AWS serverless architecture to stream IoT data, managed by python. We can be up and running in minutes―starting small, but able to easily grow to millions of devices and billions of messages.

## [Write code for humans, not machines](/assets/pdfs/writeCodeForHumans.pdf)       
Any average programmer can write code by sitting hours and hours, pushing themselves through the sleepless nights but what it takes to write a better readable code?.  
Forget about the design patterns, I will be talking ground zero from naming variables to handling errors in your python code. After the talk the audience will know how to get started with good programming habits and how not to annoy the code readers/maintainers:)

## [Concurrency vs Parallelism](/assets/slides/concurrency_vs_parallelism.pdf)     
Tasks can be made embarrassingly parallel by crunching up the resources and using all CPU cores. 
What if your resources are limited, How do we achieve the speed in execution of tasks?. In this talk 
we will discuss about achieving near parallelism with limited resources but at the same time knowing 
concurrency is not parallelism using real world examples.
