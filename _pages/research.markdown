 The group focuses on research in the field of knowledge-based systems powered by ontologies and the Semantic Web. In our projects we focus on ontology design, building RDF datasets and developing software solutions and libraries designed to create or process ontologies and RDF data.

 A list of projects we have participated in can be found on the [Projects page]({{"/projects" | relative_url}}).

 A list of all the data and software artifacts created by the group is located on the [Ontologies and Software page]({{"/software" | relative_url}}).
