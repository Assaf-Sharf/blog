 The group focuses on research in the field of Ontologies and Semantic Web. In the projects we focus on the ontology design, providing RDF datasets and development of software solutions and libraries designed to create or process ontologies and RDF data.

 The list of projects we have participated in is in the [Projects page]({{"/projects" | relative_url}}).

 The list of all the data and software artifacts created in the research projects are located in the [Ontologies and Software page]({{"/software" | relative_url}}).
