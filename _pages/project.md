## Publications/Research/Manuscripts

**Online Submodular Optimization in Network Games (Unfinished draft)**: [*Online Submodular Optimization in Network Games*]({{ "/pdfs/Submodular Network Game.pdf" | absolute_url }}). Currently an unfinished draft applying online submodular optimization (both maximization and minimization) to competitive cascade games.

## Code (Class Projects)

**Sentiment Analysis for Stock Market Prediction**: [*Report*]({{ "/pdfs/sentiment.pdf" | absolute_url }}), [Full Code](https://github.com/jorpro/DeepTimeSeries). Report for CS 294-136 Deep Learning Financial Time Series. Used Stanford NLP, NLTK for event extraction and mood sentiment scores. Used LSTM, ConvNets, and word embeddings for news feature conversion, to predict day-to-day prices from related articles on [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/company-news).

**Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning**: [*Report*]({{ "/pdfs/RARL.pdf" | absolute_url }}), [Full Code](https://github.com/Jekyll1021/RARL). Report for [CS 294-131 Special Topics in Deep Learning](https://berkeley-deep-learning.github.io/cs294-131-f17/). Re-implementation of [Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/pinto17a/pinto17a.pdf), with algorithmic game theory analysis. Experiments were extended to Berkeley DeepDrive LIDAR data (for pedestrian setting training) and image dataset CIFAR-10. 


**Delaunay Triangulation**: C++ code for Delaunay Triangulation: [Full Code](https://github.com/Srizzle/Delaunay-Triangulation) for class [CS 294 - Computational Geometry](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/274s17/)
