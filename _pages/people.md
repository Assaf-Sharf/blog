## Adam R. Rivers, PhD - PI (SY)
_PhD Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 2009_

I am a microbial ecologist turned computational biologist. I began my career
woking on nutrient limitation in marine phytoplankton and became involved in
metagenomics early. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill I applied
metatranscriptomics to understand the fate of oil and gas released. In 2014 A
became a research scientist at the Joint Genome Institute, a part of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory. I was the head of the Metagenome Program at JGI
until 2017.  In January of 2017 I joined the Agricultural Research Service to
start  the Agricultural Microbiomes Group.  

Agriculture is an exciting field to apply microbiome methods. A key question in
microbiome research is how the genetics of the host and the ecology of the
microbial community interact. Plant breeders have extensive pedigree and
genotypic information that enables us to start unraveling the interaction
experimentally. Microbiome analyses is poised to upend conventional methods for
food safety allowing us to track and eliminate pathogens, develop agricultural
systems that limit their impact through environmental manipulation. Agriculture
in an area where microbiome science will have a tremendous impact.

At the USDA Agricultural Research Service I hold a career scientist position as a
[Computational Biologist in the Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit.](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/stoneville-ms/genomics-and-bioinformatics-research/people/adam-r-rivers-phd/)

I have a courtesy faculty appointment in the Department of Microbiology and Cell science at the University of Florida.

## Ravin Poudel, PhD
_PhD University of Florida 2018_

Dr. Poudel is an ARS funded post-doctoral researcher and the Department of
Microbiology and Cell Science at the University of Florida who works in the
group. He interested in the ecology of microbial communities, mostly microbial
assemblies, diversities, interactions, and their community level functions, in
the natural as well as in the agricultural systems. He is developing software
and statistical methods to analyze data for high-throughput fitness-profiling
experiments in the model organism _E. coli_, with the aim to scale it up to other
microbes in the future. He is also working on methods to model microbial
communities using [amplicon sequencing, metabolomics, and Bayesian networks](/projects/Ralstonia_dynamic_bayesian/) in
order to identify key microbial structures and functional signatures to support
the selection of candidate taxa or microbial-consortia for microbiome-based crop
productions.
