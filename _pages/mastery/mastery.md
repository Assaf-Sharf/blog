# Start of My Journey to Master

In 2018 I was at a stage in my life where mediocracy seemed to be my only destination, a destination which I had shamefully accepted. Deep inside, I wanted more; when I was younger, I had dreams of being _successful_, but I never knew what that meant. At this point in my life, dreaming of that _success_ was something I seldom did. It was painful to consider that I would never achieve the _success_ I once imagined. I cooked up excuses that helped me digest the future I had accepted.

Luckily for me, my brother convinced me to start reading, and the first book I read was _Mastery_ by Robert Greene. The pursuit of _success_ I once had, the pursuit that I buried deep under my excuses and had a formal funeral for, was clawing out of its grave. In the past, I could never put the finger on what _success_ looked like; I always assumed it was happiness, fame, fortunes, and respect. _Success_ symbolized a significantly more fulfilling life than I was currently living, but it never had a clear definition.

After carefully studying the words of Greene, I could finally put a finger on what my soul was craving. I decided that I needed to live a life in the pursuit of _Mastery_. _Mastery_, like knowledge, is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire. I want the fire of _Mastery_ to spread far and wide, not just for tech, computers, and math. But for all forms of knowledge, innovations, and ideas.

# The Way

Over the last few years, I have followed the path. In 2022 I finished re-reading _Mastery_ once more. As I grow, my understanding of _Mastery_ has grown and evolved. As I continue to mature, my views will develop as well.

**The purpose of this section** is to capture my thoughts, ideas, and perceptions of _Mastery._ I will discuss concepts, metaphors, analysis, and examples of _Mastery_. Introception is critical when following the Way. I will capture my views at a given time in my posts. As I continue along the Way, I will look back at my past beliefs and recognize my journey and growth. These posts will serve as a guiding light for me along the Way to _Mastery, and_ hopefully, for others as well.
