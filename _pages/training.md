## Microbiome workshop 2017

In August of 2017 We held a [two day workshop on Microbiome Science](https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/Microbiome-workshop/) for 30 ARS participants.  The workshop had training for analyzing amplicon and metagenome data and focused on building a community of practice within ARS around microbiome science.  We are now organizing an ARS Microbiome Community to coordinate information sharing and collaboration.

## Machine Learning workshop August 2019

In August 2019 I organized a [two-day Machine Learning workshop](https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/ml-training-site/) in collaboration with the [UF Carpentries Club](https://www.uf-carpentries.org/) for for 50 ARS UF and USDA-ARS Scientists and UF.  The workshop introduced life scientists with some programming experience to machine learning methods. The learning objectives were to:

1. Identify the types of problems that machine learning methods can be applied to
2. Understanding of basic ML concepts like the bias-variance tradeoff, and test/train/validate
3. Gain experience applying a few types of classification and regression methods
4. Have a general sense of the methods and software available
5. Know where to go to continue learning about ML after the course
