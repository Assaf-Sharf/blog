In August of 2017 We held a [two day workshop on Microbiome Science](https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/Microbiome-workshop/) for 30 ARS participants.  The workshop had training for analyzing amplicon and metagenome data and focused on building a community of practice within ARS around microbiome science.  We are now organizing an ARS Microbiome Community to coordinate information sharing and collaboration.
