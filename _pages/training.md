## Microbiome workshop 2017

In August of 2017 We held a [two day workshop on Microbiome Science](https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/Microbiome-workshop/) for 30 ARS participants.  The workshop had training for analyzing amplicon and metagenome data and focused on building a community of practice within ARS around microbiome science.  We are now organizing an ARS Microbiome Community to coordinate information sharing and collaboration.

## Machine Learning workshop August 2019

I am organizing a training workshop for ARS Scientists modeled after the Google ML
Crash Course.  The two day workshop will be held in person in August of 2019
and will offer a hands on introduction to Machine learning methods using Tensorflow.
