## 17sic4sms (1.11.17 - 31.10.19)
Research of Intelligent Components for Safety Data Collection and Processing Systems

The goal of the project is to expedite, simplify and make more accurate the process of risk analysis and control
as well as achieving more accurate safety performance monitoring for aviation organisations.
To achieve the goal, intelligent components for existing solutions will be established as a software based on STAMP systemic safety model,
which will be conceptualised into machine-readable form with subsequent domain specification for aviation.
The goal corresponds to national priority No. 3.2 regarding process safety and reliability reinforcement.
The project duration is scheduled for 24 months.
