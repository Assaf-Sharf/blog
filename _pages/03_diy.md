# DIY Builds
There is no right way to build your own. Every build is unique. The builder should ask the purpose of the unit being constructed. Is it meant to remain stationary, at home? If so, then there would be no benefit to including a GPS receiver since the position is known and fixed. Here I present two units I built as examples. I do not assert these are the best, or most efficient, or most cost-effective designs...they're just designs that have proven practically useful.
## Solar Base Station

This unit serves as a stationary, always-on rooftop "router" node for our mesh network. It's solar panel charges a high capacity battery unit, which is more than capable of running the unit for upwards of a full week under sunless conditions.

This can almost certainly be done more cheaply. The battery bank solves an important issue for outdoor installations, especially in cold climates. It prevents charging above or bellow dangerous thresholds. Time will tell if it can sustain itself all winter, but I'll update here once I find out!
## Handheld Client Unit

This unit is meant to be a medium range walking-around client node. It's got decent range due to 1/4 wave 2dbi antenna, which diminishes its portability somewhat. It's single, rechargeable battery is sufficient to keep the unit on constantly for over a month between charges!

I was fortunately able to source a number of components, not the WizBlock, from eBay sellers at a substantial discount. I think my unit-cost was ~$50, but wanted to represent a worst-case number here.
