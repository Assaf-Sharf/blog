Apluraâ€™s foundations are rooted in security operations; therefore, we
understand the challenges with managing a system that services a critical
application. Leverage our experience with managing one of our core [technologies](/Services/Technologies) within your organization, and have piece of mind that you will get the most out of the solution.

We can provide operational management services in several flavors, depending on size and complexity of the environment:

*   Full-time administrators, engineers, or architect/developers
*   Part-time administrators, engineers, or architects

We have clients that leverage full-time engineers/architects, while some need only assistance for a week or two per month. Let us know how we can help you meet your needs of compliance and improved security without your organization having to be an expert on each solution.
