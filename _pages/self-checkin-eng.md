# Directions

the apartment is in **VIA BALDASSARRE PERUZZI 19 00054 FIUMICINO**. 

If you're arriving by train, once you get to **PARCO LEONARDO** Station, head towards the mall **CENTRO LEONARDO** (cross the tracks if you're coming from the airport) and from there use Google maps to get to the address, the distance is about 3/400 meters from the Station. Make sure the navigator doesn't take you around the one-way streets but takes you through the pedestrian plaza. 

> If you're arriving by car/Taxi/Uber, remember to clearly indicate to the driver **FIUMICINO** and not **ROME** üòÅ
