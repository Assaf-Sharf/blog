<h2>Chinatown Revitalization</h2>

A century ago, Portland had the second largest Chinese population next to San Francisco. It once counted for 10% of population in Portland. Chinatown has been not only one of the prominent landmarks but a legacy for this city. Chinatown had its up and down in the past, but never lost its hope. With the new generation of Chinese immigrants moving into this city in the last 30 years, the Chinese community has pledged to work together to revitalize Chinatown, to make it great again.
