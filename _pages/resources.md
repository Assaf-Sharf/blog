This page contains useful resources for hydrologic modelling purposes. The page will be continuously updated.
## Software
### My software
#### HYPR
**A simple HYdrological Model for Prairie Region**

The model is based on the HBV model. HYPR is currently being used operationally in Canada. HYPR is available as part of the [Raven modelling framework](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/).

#### PRIMA
**A simple hydraulic Prairie Region Inundation MApping model**

This model simulates the movement of water over prairie landscape to identify water storage and inundation extents in the pothole dominated region. PRIMA is available as part of the [MESH Land Surface Model](https://wiki.usask.ca/display/MESH/).

### Other Useful Software
#### Whitebox tools
Whitebox tools is a free open source GIS software that contains more that 500 geospatial and hydrologic analysis functions. Whitebox is fast and can be integrated into ArcMaP or QGIS. It also has a [Python](https://github.com/giswqs/whitebox-python) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/whitebox/index.html) frontend packages.
