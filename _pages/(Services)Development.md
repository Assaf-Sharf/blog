# Splunk Development

Applications are an important part of every day life. The machine data that these applications generate can provide great insight into how systems are operating, where issues may arise, as well as security related information that could indicate a breach when correlated with other data. By using Splunk’s platform to ingest and manage this data, it becomes possible to provide a single pane of glass for operations and analyst, but also it becomes a launch point to integrate with external applications to get the most out of the relationship.

As a Splunk partner since 2008, Aplura’s development team stays ahead of the curve by closely coordinating with Splunk product management and application developers. Additionally, Aplura’s established processes for scoping and creating Splunk apps to integrate with external software, ensures a well-made and innovative final product.
