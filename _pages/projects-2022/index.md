## 1 - Quantum Algorithms 
* **Project Area :** Linear algebra, Logical Thinking
* **Mentors :** Fahad Sheikh (Mando#5308)
* **Description :** I have done a similar project last year, where I have done problems from Quantum Computing Nielson and Chung. Some parts of this project will be the same, but at the end of the project I would like for mentees to present a literature review on a set of topics I will give them. I would mainly focus on Nielson and Chung for understanding the basics, and would like to introduce more algorithms other than Shor's Algorithm and Grover's algorithm. The mentees have to present a paper on a topic, so that it can make me sure what have they understood in the project.

* **Expected Duration :** This project will be held for 12 weeks, discluding the time for preparation of Endsems and Endsems week

If time permits, we may look at selected topics in Operator Theory, including exposure to research-level problems.

    This project will help students develop not only an understanding of Functional Analysis but also inculcate an attitude of mathematical inquiry in general. There will be an emphasis (and no compromise) on mathematical rigor. The pace of the project will be dictated by the mathematical maturity of the group.

    Prerequisites:
(i) MTH301A* (A First Course in Real Analysis) or equivalent. 

    (ii) General Topology (specifically Ch. 2,3 of Munkres' Topology).

   (iii) Introductory Measure Theory (including Riesz Representation Theorem, Radon Measures, etc.)
Additionally, you will be required to prepare a report in LaTeX, and proficiency in the same is a must. 

    (ii) and (iii) are desirable but not necessary. If you are not sure whether you meet the prerequisites for this project, please get in touch with the mentor directly.

    *You may register for this project even if you are taking MTH301A in the 2021-22 II semester.

* **Intended Audience :** Only UG students. Though anyone fulfilling the prerequisites may request to register, the project will mainly be of interest to Y20 MTH and PHY UGs. Y21s should not apply unless they have sufficient (and provable) mathematical background.
* **Expected Duration :** 4-5 months  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment :** At least 12 hours per week (involves significant self study and exercises).
