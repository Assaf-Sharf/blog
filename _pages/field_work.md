I have done some really rewarding field work over the years while working with
Atmospheric Boundary Layer. You can find a few pictures below.

### Amazon - BR (October 2015)

Field work in the Amazon whose goal was to aid installation of instruments
at the [ATTO project](https://www.attoproject.org/) site.

### Tijucas do sul - BR (around 2014)

The goal of this field was to measure meteorological variables with a drone
while also taking auxiliary micromet measurements on ground.

fluxes on lakes and sensor decorrelation effects.
