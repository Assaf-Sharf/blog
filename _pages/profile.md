My name is Gabriel F P Araujo, nice to meet you. I'm mechatronics engineering student in University of Brasilia, Brazil and undergraduate researcher at LARA (Automation and Robotics Laboratory). I work with robotics estimation and navigation. I'm currently working with SDR development, software defined radio for mobile robots localization using multi-constellation GNSS systems.
