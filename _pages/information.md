# Guidelines

Work together to create innovative solutions for decentralized identity technology. Each track has example prompts that could be used for building a solution. You are only expected to select one of the prompts below. All of the tracks will be judged equally. Collaborating in teams is highly encouraged!


## Track 1 - Use Cases

- Browsing the internet feels anything but private these days due to constant surveillance, data breaches, and lack of control. How can decentralized identity be leveraged to ensure privacy and protect our identities when weâ€™re interacting online?
- More than 1.1 billion people have no official, legally-recognized identity which prevents access to everything from basic services to banking, education, and more. How can decentralized identity technology empower these individuals?
- The metaverse enables new digital experiences that require new ways of using and sharing our digital identities. How can we leverage decentralized identity technology to enhance how we interact in the metaverse?


## Track 2 - Features

- How would you create a new digital identity for the future that is shareable and private?
- What is the best way to render a Verifiable Credential in a product considering both technical requirements and user experience?
- How can biometrics be incorporated into the issuance and/or verification process for Verifiable Credentials?


## Track 3 - Choose your own adventure
- Create something new, interesting, and/or provoking that embraces decentralized identity!

<br/>

# Deliverables

Submissions and demos can be shared in the following ways:
- Mockups
- Wireframes
- Technical Proof of Concept
- Powerpoint presentation

<br/>

# Submission deadline

for example: teams should post to the Submissions Discord channel by {date, time} to be considered. Each submission should include:
- Team name
- Team participants
- Solution description

<br/>

# Demos

for example: teams should prepare a 2-3 minute presentation to be shared during the closing ceremony, judges may ask questions as part of the demonstration

<br/>

# Judging Criteria

**Fundamentals** - How well does the solution consider and showcase concepts core to decentralized identity?

**Functionality** - Is this a solution that can be realistically implemented? To what extent has the team attempted to demonstrate functionality?

**Usefulness** - Is the solution practical and useful? Does the solution consider real-world adoption?

**Creativity** - How innovative is the solution?
