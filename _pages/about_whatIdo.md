### Services with Multidisciplinary Perspective

My services apply to a variety of fields as a reflection of my multidisciplinary background, from pharma/biotech to managerial and human-science/behavioral fields. And comprises from 

- data acquisition;

- data analysis;

- research design, including survey planning;

The major tools used in these services are R and Python, thought other tools can be used in specific cases.


### My posts

This page is just a complementary page for host codes and projects. And thought organized by categories, the page is not designed to have a plain narrative. Soon, you will be able to refer to my [medium profile](tomoegusberti.medium.com) for posts using the codes available here to explain how they can be useful for your specific problems. (I am just getting the posts ready. Unfortunately, there is no post made public yet).

I write posts at [medium](tomoegusberti.medium.com) a little because I love teaching and sharing knowledge. And in my collaboration, I am always actually worried about all parts being actually aware of what is going on in any data analysis, recommendation, or decision-making process. It means increasing the literacy of data analysis and related subjects, especially when non-literate professionals are involved. I believe we must share the knowledge if we want to make the industries more mature and effectively data-driven.

- What are my posts about? 

- Some intend to explain some specific statistical/analytic methods and approaches.

- Some reflect my enjoyment writing about quality in data science. 

- They usually have a multidisciplinary perspective. And are conducted in a dialectic way.

- Most of the code examples hosted here support such posts. You will find lot of explanation dispersed there.

I believe the posts at [medium](tomoegusberti.medium.com) will give you also a glance at this multidisciplinary perspective.
