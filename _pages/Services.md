# Information Security Services

The information security environment of the modern organization is, in a word, challenging. Data sources abound as do the threats arrayed against them. Yet all too often the very security processes put in place to identify and mitigate against such threats are themselves compromised by poorly conceived planning and execution.

That’s where we come in. Aplura is an experienced information security consultancy with a proven track record of creating the kinds of tailored, flexible solutions our government, private sector and institutional clients need to meet today’s rapidly evolving compliance and threat detection environments.
