The [Huberman Lab](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndrewHubermanLab) is one of my all-time favorite podcasts. Dr. Huberman is an excellent speaker, teacher, and scientist. He does a great job teaching neuroscience to a large spectrum of students. If you simply want to learn the high-level neuroscience mechanisms, this podcast is for you. If you want to learn all the nitty-gritty details and terminology, this podcast is also for you.

Dr. Huberman is doing a great job spreading the message of science and science-based tools that we can all implement to live better lives.
