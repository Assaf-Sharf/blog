## About the Data
The initial dataset covers all of the major cloud providers and their regions around the world. In the future, I will work to include regional and niche providers. Here is a list of cloud providers that are covered in the initial dataset:

## Project Info and Disclaimer
investigate.cloud is a project created to provide geospatial data about cloud providers in a transparent, neutral way. 

So far, the majority of the data collected for investigate.cloud has been collected manually via publicly available information from cloud providers websites. More and more, I am working towards collecting data programmatically via APIs. I am not a developer by trade, and am looking for help. If you are interested in contributing to the project send me an email.

Although the data on this site has been produced and processed from sources believed to be reliable, no warranty, expressed or implied, is made regarding accuracy, adequacy, completeness, legality, reliability or usefulness of any information. The information is provided on an "as is" and "best effort" basis. 
{: .notice--warning}

My long term goal is to make the project open source and provide programmatic access to the data sources via API.

investigate.cloud is not affiliated with any cloud providers and will not accept any compensation in return for improving data. In the future, I will look into monetizing the project to cover costs via sponsorships. If you are concerned with practices and metrics used in this benchmark feel free to contact me via mail or Twitter.
