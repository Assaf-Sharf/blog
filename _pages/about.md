A story teller that codes. 

A quant, data scientist, pianist and a polygot. I love automating processes so that my mind can focus on understanding human behaviors and making ideas spread.

Currently lives in Singapore.

Minimalist, contrarian and taming my lizard brain. 

Motto: [Maranasati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maranasati).

Check out my [project]({{ basepath }}/project/){:target="_blank"} page to see what I'm doing now. 

I'll love to [grab a cup of coffee]({{ basepath }}/contact) with you too.
