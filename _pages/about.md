Welcome to Raghhuveer Jaikanth's blog! 

I am an undergraduate student from Chennai, India with a major in Computer Science. I am looking forward to join Univeristy of Reading, UK for their Masters in Data Science program. 

I am deeply passionate about **Machine Learning, AI and Computer Vision** and the branches of mathematics that come with these topics such as linear Algebra, Projective Geometry and much more. This blog covers over these topics as well as implementation in both C++ and Python using various libraries such as Eigen, Nupmy, Boost and OpenCV. 

I have worked for almost 2 years with **Danske Bank** with their IT department as a **Platform Engineer** and developed a intelligent platform - Quantexa, which was used by Financial Crime Reporters to uncover money laundering networks or dangerous transactions involving terrorist organizations. We used **Apache Spark with Scala** for creating and maintaing the backend ETL along with **Airflow** to automate this process. The final cleansed data was then uploaded to an **ElasticSearch** server. For the UI we used **angular+typescript** to create meaningful and interactive UIs for the end users.

I follow football almost religiously and try not miss any match where my favourite team (F.C. Barcelona) is playing. I also enjoy listening to a variety of genres of music from Indian Classical and Indian BV=ollywood to Heavy Metal and Hard Rock to EDM. I also play the violin. 

Feel free to add me on social media. You can find the links at the footer/author profile.

Cheers and have a good day!
