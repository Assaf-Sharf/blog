I love the problem of finding the best plan in the face of uncertainty. This often results in some mix of Mathematical Optimization and Machine Learning. I use whatever tool is best for the job. Helping people find an answer is more important than being dogmatic about any particular technology.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (@McCrews) or LinkedIn.
