Hi, I am a last-year undergraduate student in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). Previously, I was a research assistant at SCUT Machine Intelligence Lab (SMIL), working closely with Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. Qing Du. I also worked with Prof. [Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/homepage) at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm). Besides, I spent wonderful five months as an exchange student in the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae in PDF format](../files/Minqian_Liu_CV.pdf).

## Research Interests
My primary research interests lie in the field of **natural language processing** and **computational linguistics**. Specifically, I am interested in the following research topics: <br>
1) Knowledge-driven information extraction: extracting structured knowledge from text with commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning; <br>
2) Natural language generation: text summarization, machine translation, and automatic evaluation for text generation; <br>
3) Syntax and parsing, especially dependency parsing and coping with syntactic ambiguity.
