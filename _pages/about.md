Hi, Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. And thank you for getting interested in my ‘about’ page.

I love coding, analyzing data and statistics. I am a scientific consultant because I am passionate about working with decision making in challenging contexts, such as complex problems and complex data, in a confluence of perspectives on multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary problems. With data science/analysis services, I care about quality and innovation to guarantee analytical results, and recommendations are useful to guarantee qualified and really effective solutions, and competitiveness.

In the following links, I detail a little more about me:

- [who I am](about/whoIam)

- [what I do](about/whatIdo)

- [how you can find me](about/howFindMe)

Please message me about your perceptions of the materials and related content/posts. I would love to hear from you!
