* More or less this is how my day looks like, I will usually be sitting and coding in some dark corner, If I am not coding, I will be cycling around the roads and hills. If not doing both, I will be treating myself with some gluten-free treats.       
* I show up late to meetings at [MadStreetDen](https://www.madstreetden.com/). 
* In my 4 years of industry experience I've worn plenty of hats- like the one of a Trainer, Embedded Engineer and Backend/Product Engineer and sometimes even helmets- when I'm out cycling.      
* I am currently on a mission to help startups to design and write usable software even before making it reusable.
