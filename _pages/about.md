This site is for highlighting research updates and perspectives written by members and friends of [Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/)'s lab in the CIS Department at UPenn. 

We study how and why machine learning fails, and develop (through theory and experimentation) ways to debug, fix, and improve these models.
