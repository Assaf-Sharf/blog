Hi, Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. And thank you for getting interested in my ‘about’ page.

I love coding, analyzing data and statistics. I am a scientific consultant because I am passionate about working with decision making in challenging contexts, such as complex problems and complex data, in a confluence of perspectives on multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary problems. With data science/analysis services, I care about quality and innovation to guarantee analytical results, and recommendations are useful to guarantee qualified and really effective solutions, security and competitiveness.

I love the opportunity to show you how I can assist you! 

## Who I am

I am an experienced scientific consultant using mainly R and Python to offer data analysis services.

I am originally an industrial pharmacist with experience in both industry and academy. I have implemented a quality management system in a start up company, and I have worked as a quality assurance manager. I was granted for a research grant to implement business intelligence and patent analytic process in a local university. I worry about decision making in innovative and dynamic contexts as a doctor in industrial engineering. As a scientific consultant, I have collaborated with start ups, researchers and professionals from several fields (medical, marketing, technology). And have brought insights about factors influencing medical outcomes; demand forecast for products; assessed technology source alternatives; surveys to get insights about human perception; and so on.

### Multidisciplinary Background

So my services apply to a variety of fields as a reflection of my multidisciplinary background, from pharma/biotech to managerial and human-science/behavioral fields. 
Sounds unrelated fields? Not at all. The rationale for data analysis in these fields is similar. To deal with the complexity of phenomena pertaining to the data, we can get richer insights if we translate accordingly. For example:
- Maybe the data is medical. Physiological and lab parameters are the obvious variables. But the patient's feelings and perception also matter, and we have perception-based scales in the dataset.
- If we look at the history, we see data analysis (stats) methods transposing the limits of knowledge fields and industries to become authoritative tools in another one…


## What I do

My services apply to a variety of fields as a reflection of my multidisciplinary background, from pharma/biotech to managerial and human-science/behavioral fields. And comprises from 

- data acquisition;

- data analysis;

- research design, including survey planning;

The major tools used in these services are R and Python, thought other tools can be used in specific cases.

### My posts

This page is just a complementary page for host codes and projects. And thought organized by categories, the page is not designed to have a plain narrative. Soon, you will be able to refer to my [medium profile](tomoegusberti.medium.com) for posts using the codes available here to explain how they can be useful for your specific problems. (I am just getting the posts ready. Unfortunately, there is no post made public yet).

I write posts at [medium](tomoegusberti.medium.com) a little because I love teaching and sharing knowledge. And in my collaboration, I am always actually worried about all parts being actually aware of what is going on in any data analysis, recommendation, or decision-making process. It means increasing the literacy of data analysis and related subjects, especially when non-literate professionals are involved. I believe we must share the knowledge if we want to make the industries more mature and effectively data-driven.


- What are my posts about? 

  - Some intend to explain some specific statistical/analytic methods and approaches.
  
  - Some reflect my enjoyment writing about quality in data science. 
  
  - They usually have a multidisciplinary perspective. And are conducted in a dialectic way.
  
- Most of the code examples hosted here support such posts. You will find more explanation there.
