_A part of the USDA ARS [Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/stoneville-ms/genomics-and-bioinformatics-research/people/adam-r-rivers-phd//)_


The Agricultural Microbiome Group focuses on developing new computational
methods to advance agriculture by understanding and controlling microbial
communities and enabling agricultural researchers to use microbiome data.  
The lab has a unique research-service model. We are in a service unit of the
 ARS which runs its own sequencing center and provides consulting and
 collaborative support to the the 2000 scientists and postdocs across the ARS
 with a particular focus on scientists in the Southeast.  We also conduct
 research into new computational methods in microbiome science.

### Research areas
* Application of machine learning to agricultural data
* Statistical analysis of compositional count data
* Viral metagenomics

### Service areas:
* Design and Sequencing of metagenome and metatranscriptome experiments
* The development of training courses for ARS, like our [2017 ARS Microbiome Workshop](https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/Microbiome-workshop/)
* Design of Amlicon sequencing (16S) experiments
* Development of amplicon sequencing services in conjunction with our Stoneville sequencing lab
* Guide ARS's Scientific computing initiative as Chair of the SCINet Advisory Committee
