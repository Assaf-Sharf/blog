## The Blog
All the Layers was established in 2016 with the purpose of exploring various aspects of information technology, automation and web development.  What All the Layers aims to do differently is to focus on the bigger picture of implementing a solution or a technology rather than isolated examples and snippets.  We put to the test some of the ideologies and methodologies practiced within the industry to see how we can implement them in a real-world example.

In the early days of this blog we will be building a social network, deploying it into a production-like environment and document each step of the way.  

As the blog becomes more established we will be looking at new technologies and see how we can implement it into the existing app.

## Me

I'm currently a Sr. Internet Engineer at Mastercard who was forged in the fires of Web Operations and provided on-call support for various web applications for five years and eventually transferred into a development oriented team focusing on continuous delivery and automation.  I'm also primarily a self-taught developer/programer with my only formal education being a two-year degree in network administration.

I like to think of myself as an "Ops" guy who, for the longest time, echoed the calls of "We've been doing it this way for years, why change?"  As the infrastructure-as-code and DevOps movement swept the industry and finally reached the doorsteps at work, this "Ops Guy" was now being challenged by the notions and concepts such as pipelines, configuration management and automation.  With this shift in gears towards a more automated future, once strictly infrastructure people would soon become developers.

I look at this shift as a welcomed challenge, and in my opinion, the future really is everything as code.  With computer science finally being introduced into the curriculum of grade-schools, it's a matter of time before everyone is a developer of some sort.

## In the Real World

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer I like to spend time cooking or researching better methods for cooking different dishes etc.  Coming from an Italian family, food and company is a big part of my life and I'm always on the look out on how to create a good meal and share it with others.

Outside I typically like enjoying time outside.  Nothing too exciting, just any form of fresh air is always welcomed away from a computer.
