I am an undergraduate student majoring **Energy Resources Engineering**, ERE. I'm interested in **Petroleum Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning**. I am going to do an internship at **Center of Subsurface Resources Development**, CSRD, during the winter vacation. <br>

Recently, I'm learning new computer languages, such as Matlab, Python, HTML and CSS, and data science.
So I'm taking an interest in programming using these languages and how to apply to my industry.

I like enjoying sports and exercising, especially table tennis, tennis, and running, and playing the game, Kartrider.
