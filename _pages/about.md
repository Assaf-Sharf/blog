I am **Alen Alex**.  
I am a software developer at **Microsoft**.  


I started my career in _2011_, and have been having fun since ;).

Here is a look at my career.

* **Infosys Technologies Limited** : _(August 1 2011 - July 1 2014)_  
I was part of _Mobility Unit_. Having worked on few interesting projects as a .Net developer, playing around with _C#_.

---------------------

* **Oracle India Pvt. Ltd.** : _(July 7 2014 - February 8 2018)_  
I was part of _Identity Management (IDM)_ at Oracle. After having worked on their _On-Prem_ solution for almost an year, I moved to _**Oracle Cloud**_, where I played around with all the fancy terms like _Microservices_, _Active Directory_, etc. developing using both _Java_ and _C#_ technologies.

---------------------

* **GlobalLogic** [for client **Ericsson**] : _(February 12 2018 - July 7 2018)_  
A short stint at _GlobalLogic_, having worked for _Ericsson_ on their cloud based media platform namely _Media First_ gave me my first exposure to _Asp.Net Core_. My major chunk of work was to migrate the existing Asp.Net application to Asp.Net Core.

---------------------

* **Microosft** : _(July 16 2018 - Present)_  
I am part of _Supply Chain Engineering_ which is part of _Core Service Engineering_ at _Microsoft_. I will be working on _.Net Core_ based applications, (obviously). Other than that, I am still figuring out my life around at _Microsoft_.

---------------------

Well, life is more than just career. More about _me_:

* **Music**  
I've been into _music_ since my childhood. Having born into a family where everyone has some bit of _music_ in their life one way or other.  
Every one in my Mother's family sings well, and my Father writes songs/poems.  
Both my Sisters sing well.  
And, as for me, I'm into _Musical Instruments_.
I am majorly a keyboardist. I have also put my hand into Guitar and Drums, but I'm no expert at either.  
_Rythums_ excite me. Be it _drums_, or any sort of _percussion_. I enjoy beating rythm on the _table_, or on _myself_ or _anywhere_ that makes sound.  
I am part of a _Gospel Band_ named _[Deo Gratias](https://www.facebook.com/DeoGratiasband/)_. 

----------------------------------

* **Photography**  
I've liked _photography_ from my school time, although I didn't have a _camera_ back then. I would get my friends' camera and take pics anytime I got a chance. I was the man behind the _camera_ for many of the short films that we did while I was at college.  
I now have a _Canon 700 D_ to play around with.  
I have uploaded a few of my pics here at [500px](https://500px.com/alenalex114).
