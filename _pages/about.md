# About

This blog is for highlighting research updates and perspectives written members and friends of [Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/)'s lab. 

Our goal is to study why machine learning fails, and develop principled foundations (through theory and experimentation) to ultimately fix these models.
