## Hey there.

I am Tanner. I'm a Junior Software Developer at Union Pacific in Omaha, Nebraska. I enjoy learning new skills to solve technical challenges. I am also a Director for [IfThen](https://www.ifthentech.com/) and co-organizer for [EBCT 2019](https://ebct2019.com/).

I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
