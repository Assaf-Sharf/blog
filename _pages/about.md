I am developer and analyist working for an e-commerce retailer based in Portland, OR USA. I have fallen in love with F# and am wanting to get the word out on what a wonderful language it is. It beautifully meets my needs in the areas of analytics, statistics, and optimization. This is primarily a practical application blog. I talk about how features in F# help make my code more robust, reliable, and performant.

I use C# and SQL as necessary. I use R when I cannot find what I need in F#.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (@McCrews) or LinkedIn. If you have any question regarding using F# and what the transition is like, I would love to chat!
