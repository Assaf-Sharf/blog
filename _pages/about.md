I study the Earth's ocean, its physics and motion, and
the infinite entanglement of its eddies, turbulence, currents, and waves.
I do a lot of math, write code that runs on supercomputers, and 
very occasionally go to [sea].
I love to learn and to teach, to think about past and future, and to 
run, climb, ski, and explore the landscapes of Earth.

I moved back to Boston in November 2016 to start postdoctoral research 
at [MIT][office], where I've been working on ocean mixing, [parameterization of 
oceanic processes][clima], [large eddy simulation], and [ice climbing].

If I'm not answering email, I may be somewhere beyond the end of the road, 
exploring this wonderful planet...
