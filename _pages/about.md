## Hey there.

I am Tanner. I'm a Junior Software Developer at Union Pacific in Omaha, Nebraska. I enjoy learning new skills to solve technical challenges. I am also Assistant Director for [IfThen](https://www.ifthentech.com/) and co-organizer for [EBCT 2019](https://ebct2019.com/) Conference.

I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. While studying, I was the Founding Director for [CornHacks](https://cornhacks.com/) and the President of the [CSE Advisory Board](https://unl-csesab.com/).
