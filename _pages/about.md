## About Me

Hi, Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. And thank you for getting interested in my ‘about’ page.

I love coding, analyzing data and statistics. I am a scientific consultant because I am passionate about working with decision making in challenging contexts, such as complex problems and complex data, in a confluence of perspectives on multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary problems.
