<h2>About</h2>
I am a versatile and self-taught creative with expertise in design, writing, and illustration. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Journalism and am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Visualization Design at University of the Arts, London. My skill set encompasses data journalism, data visualisation, graphic design, digital illustration, and *taking care of cats*. I enjoy tackling multidisciplinary projects and am driven by a passion for continuous learning.
