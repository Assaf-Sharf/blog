Welcome to Raghhuveer Jaikanth's blog! I am an undergraduate student from India with a major in Computer Science. I am looking to do a Master's in Data Science hopefully in 2021. 

This blog's topics cover Computer Vision, Projective Geometry, Machine Learning, C/C++, Pytorch and much more.

I love playing football, listening to music and playing the violin. 

Feel free to add me on social media. You can find the links at the footer/author profile.

Cheers and have a good day!
