Hi everyone! I'm Taha Monfared, a statistics graduate student. I have designed this website to work like a diary to me and maybe a good dictionary of things that may go wrong in your conceptual problems and maybe coding problems! There is no easy way to learn what we do and there is surely no easy way to code in R, without checking StackOverflow once in a while. This can be a small reflection of the knowledge dispersed on the web that had helped me achieve what is presented here. It could help you if you have the same problems, or you may enlighten me about other possible solutions to my problems. 

Although this is not the place, I think I should thank my professors here at CSU Fullerton, as they have guided me towards better understanding of mathematical backbone of statistics, honing my skills and inflaming my thirst for more statistical knowledge. I encourage every data scientist, data analyst, machine learning expert, data analytics expert, or statistician to really get dirty with the theories behind statistical tools. Maybe some day we can evolve it even further. 

I am currently considering pursuing PhD. Although I am 33 now- and that's worrying to me - academic growth has gave me such pleasure throughout these last few years, that I may have got additced to it.  

Aside from academics, I am new to United States job market. I have been a research assistant to CSUF graduate office for around two years and as great as it had been after this summer I wouldn't be a student here anymore. So if anyone is interested in recruting a statistician or a data analyst, I am available to hire. My linkedin profile includes most of the information provided in my resume. But just in case [My Resume](/assets/Taha_Monfared_Resume.pdf) can be printed out following the hyperlink.
