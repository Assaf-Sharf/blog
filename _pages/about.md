DevCycle is an IT consultancy with just under thirty years of
Architecture, Design and Software Development experience. We also have
over nineteen years of Lean and Agile coaching experience.

We work across a number of industries, with the particular aim of supplying
systems which apply ‘big data’ tools and techniques to solve critical
business problems.

We couple this hands-on analytical and technology work with
consultancy expertise, with a particular emphasis on helping clients
to form practical data strategies and build their internal capacity to gain insights from data.
