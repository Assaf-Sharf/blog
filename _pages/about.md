Hi, I am a last-year undergraduate student from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). Currently, I am working closely with Prof. [Shengfeng He](http://www.shengfenghe.com/). Previously, I was a research assistant at SCUT Machine Intelligence Lab (SMIL), working closely with Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. Qing Du. I also worked with Prof. [Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) and [Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/homepage) at Sun Yat-sen University. I was also a visiting student at [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](../files/Minqian_Liu_CV.pdf).

**I am actively seeking for a Ph.D. position in NLP, computer vision, deep learning, and related areas starting from Fall 2021. Feel free to drop me a line if interested!**

## Research Interests
My research interests include **few-shot learning**, deep learning for **natural language processing** (e.g., dialogue system) and **computer vision**, as well as machine learning for healthcare. I am also interested in robustness of deep learning and reinforcement learning.

## News
