excerpt: "DevCycle is an IT consultancy."
---

DevCycle is an IT consultancy with just over thirty years of
Architecture, Design and Software Development experience. We also have
over nineteen years of Lean and Agile coaching experience.

We work across a number of industries, with the particular aim of supplying
systems which apply development tools and techniques to solve critical
business problems.

We couple this hands-on analytical and technology work with
consultancy expertise, with a particular emphasis on helping clients
to form practical data strategies and build their internal capacity to gain insights from data.

DevCycle specialises in providing consultancy to solve problems
clients are experiencing in developing bespoke software, software
architecture and data engineering. We take a holistic approach to
software consultancy and consider software technology, development process
and any social engineering of an organisation that may be required.

We are not in the business of providing 'bodies' to augment clients
existing capability but in radically rethinking approaches to make
better use of a clients existing resources and providing guidance and
support for that journey.

DevCycle has contacts across the software development industry that we
partner with if a client needs specialist services such as data
scientists, infrastructure/cloud architecture, etc.
