I was born in Toronto, spent the first 5 years of my life outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia and then my family moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Growing up in North Carolina I was quite devoted to my studies, participating in state-wide math and science completions as well as Battle of the Books. As a high school senior, I was a recipient of Microsoft's You can Make A Difference international scholarship program as well as the country wide Apple Scholars program. I dedicated a lot of my time to helping the community and served as secretary and president of my local Key Club, eventually serving as the webmaster for the North and South Carolina Key Club.  


# Education

As I have always been fascinated with computers and decided that I wanted to major in Computer Science, which led me to attend [Case Western Reserve University](http://case.edu/) in Cleveland, Ohio. During my freshmen year I realized that computer science can be applied to almost every discipline, thus I began also studying economics. My sophomore year led me to dive deeper into biology, eventually leading to me concentrating in bioinformatics and computational biology. Beginning the summer after my sophomore year, I joined a research team attempting to discover proteins that affected tumor growth, and this led me to understand and apply graph theory to solve one facet of this problem. My resulting predictions were then validated using mRNAi studies. At the same time, I was working as the primary web developer for the School of Arts & Sciences (at Case) and worked on creating the Drupal CMS that is now ubiquitously used at Case. 

Unfortunately, I suffered serious injuries the summer before my senior year that left me paralyzed from the waist down, but that did not stop me physically or mentally! I spent the next few years enduring vigorous physical therapy, leading me to Orlando, San Diego and Tampa. During this period, I continued my learning via MOOCs such as Coursera, Udacity and Udemy where I obtained over 20 certifications, eventually graduating from [Thinkful's Data Science Program](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/data-science/flexible/) in April of 2019. This was a 6-month program experimenting with analytics using the Python coding language along with Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning models. I eventually specialized in convolutional neural networks and applying them to solve problems outside of computer vision, especially natural language. Keras offers an intuitive interface for developing deep learning models, however, lately I have been using fastai and PyTorch. The field is constantly evolving, and I am always eager to learn new things!


# Interests  

I am very interested in nature, particularly northwestern North America, such as Banff, Salt Lake City, Moab and Yosemite. Being born in Toronto I am inherently a big Toronto Maple Leafs fan (our time is coming!). Quantitative trading also fascinates me; I dabbled in this field for a little over a year and quickly learned that it is very promising! I find enjoyment in finding the needle in a haystack; untangling a giant mess of data to discover something meaningful. Whether this be sensitive health data (breast cancer), State of the Union addresses or molecular data, data science can assist in detecting subtle variations in nearly anything.
