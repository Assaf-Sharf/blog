_A part of the USDA ARS [Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/stoneville-ms/genomics-and-bioinformatics-research/people/adam-r-rivers-phd//)_


My Research group focuses on developing new computational
methods to advance agriculture by understanding and controlling microbial
communities and applying machine learning to agricultural data.  

The lab has a unique research-service model. We are in a service unit of the
ARS which runs its own sequencing center and provides consulting and
collaborative support to the the 2000 scientists and postdocs across the ARS
with a particular focus on scientists in the Southeast.  We also conduct
research into new computational methods

### Research areas
* Applying machine learning to agricultural data (sequence, image, and chemometric data)
* Engineering and optimizing microbial consortia
* Developing Software (e.g. Itsxpress, Guidemaker) for bioinformatics
* Applying Volatiles mass spectrometry and Machine learning to agricultural challenges
* Viral metagenomics

### Service areas:
* Design and Sequencing of amplicon, metagenome and metatranscriptome experiments
* The development of training courses for ARS, like our [2019 UF/ARS Machine learning Workshop](https://scinet.usda.gov/training-archive/2019-08-27-Gainesville-FL/)
* I help guide [SCINet](https://scinet.usda.gov) ARS's scientific computing initiative as Chair of the SCINet Advisory Committee
* I an working to establish the ARS AI Center of Excellence in collaboration
with our Associate Administrator and Chief Scientific information officer
* Editorial board for the journal [ACS Agriculture Science and Technology](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/aastgj)
