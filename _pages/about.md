# Introduction

My name is Abdul Rabbani. I am a self-educated computer scientist. Most of my knowledge has been acquired from real-world experience, books, and online resources. Because I didn’t learn technology in a classroom, I have an advantage. While classroom instruction is limited to sometimes outdated topics, I have spent my time learning practical, real-world technology from experts in the field. My experience and fields of expertise range from low-level applications and operating systems to designing, creating, and scaling cloud infrastructure in an automated fashion.

Besides technology, I have a deep love for math and science. I hope to continue to grow and expand my knowledge in both fields. I also hope to grow in fields that are outside my comfort zone. As someone who grew up in love with numbers, data, and analytics, I often neglected my creative side. I will strive to become more in touch with this side by drawing, reading, writing, and dabbling in poetry.

# Purpose of This Site

The main purpose of this website is for me to consolidate and keep track of my work. As I continue to learn, grow, and express myself over the years, I can easily go back and re-learn something that I wrote about years earlier.  In addition, I strongly believe that writing about what you learn helps cement your knowledge and understanding. Overall, through this website, I want to capture my growth as an engineer, as a scientist, and most of all, as a person.

Finally, I created this website as a means of collaborating with people who share my interests and curiosity. If you see a topic that intrigues you, feel free to comment about things you like, dislike, agree with, disagree with, or want further explanation on. My email is linked here: [abdulrabbani00@gmail.com](mailto:abdulrabbani00@gmail.com). If you would like to connect, feel free to reach out.

## Types of Posts

You’ll notice various _types_ of posts as you go along. I will do my best to capture the _type_ of the post as a tag. Let me give you an example: My favorite branch of Mathematics is Calculus.

-   **Personal**: I could write an article on the importance of Calculus to me and the influence it has had in my life. This type of post would be a **Personal** post, where I am writing about an aspect of my life.

-   **Opinionated**: I could also write a post on how I believe all high schools should offer Calculus classes. This type of post would be an **Opinionated** post, where I am sharing an idea, or something that I believe.

-   **Factual**: I could also write a post explaining the _Fundamental Theorem Of Calculus_. This type of post would be a **Factual** post, where I am explaining something (correctly I hope).

-   **Discovery**: I may also write about a brand new finding I might have in Calculus. This type of post would be a **Discovery** post, where I explain my scientific discovery in thorough detail.

-   **Notes**: I may be learning about a new topic within Calculus, and I might create a post with explanations, questions, and other notes I have about the topic. This type of post would be a **Notes** post (I know, very creative). This will more than likely be the most common type of post on this site.


# Technical Experience

As someone who has had various roles in different organizations, I have amassed experience and expertise in many topics. I have experience in many topics, from creating and scaling large infrastructure in an automated fashion, to analyzing latency and performance for low-latency trading applications. I have a broad range of knowledge, which provides me with a unique perspective in the technical field.

## Currently

I am taking some time to grow, learn, and work on personal projects. Now that I have spent a few years in the technical space, working in different roles, I have gotten a taste of what I like, and more importantly, what I don’t like.  In addition, I have a better understanding of what is out there, which is important, considering how expansive and convoluted tech is. When I first started, I didn't know what I didn’t know, now I know what I know, and I know what I don't know (you might want to read that twice).

Specifically, I am using this time to grow in the technical areas that interest me the most. This includes kernel development, network programming, C, and other low-level tools and concepts. Unlike in college where you are learning the broad strokes of tech, or on the job, where you learn what you’re exposed to, I want to take the time to learn what **interests me**. Finally, I also plan on reading, writing, drawing, and growing in other fields that are non-technical.

### Interview Prep

Besides wearing my student hat and spending time learning and growing, I would also like to help those who are in the technical field. I have started a project where I will be helping engineers in the technical space practice for their interviews so that they may land their dream job. Learn more about interview prep (link-here).

### Microsoft-PromoteIQ

In my most recent role, I was a DevOps Engineer at a start-up called PromoteIQ, which is owned by Microsoft. PromoteIQ is an advertising firm that works in the private market place. My job here was to maintain all the servers, networks, applications, and infrastructure to be able to serve ads for our clients.

Part of being a good DevOps Engineer is making sure you are not doing the same work twice. Infrastructure, applications, networks, servers, and other pieces of technology constantly need to be replicated and changed. Technology is great because if you're lazy (like me), you can program it to do a lot for you. Some of the tools that I leveraged to make my life easier were _Ansible, Python, Terraform, and Jenkins_.

Like many companies, we live on the cloud, and not just one. To meet client needs we have applications on _AWS, GCP, Azure, Rackspace, and Digital Ocean_. Due to strong leadership, and smart engineers, we can serve clients out of various clouds with ease. PromoteIQ is a smart, sleek, and truly advanced shop in today's day in age, with automation and growth in mind.

### Societe Generale

Before working for PromoteIQ, I was an SRE at Societe Generale, primarily focusing on the technology of the high-frequency, low-latency trading desk. My main focus was maintaining trading applications, with latency and performance in mind. Some of my topics of interest were _Microwave, Market Data, and Smart Order Routing (SOR)_.

At SocGen, I learned to work very closely with physical hardware. Although  I did not touch any servers in my time there, I was quickly able to decipher the right tool for the right job. Furthermore, with the help of some talented individuals, I became a proficient programmer at SocGen.

I started by learning _Python_ and quickly began working on the ILP (Internal Market Provider) project. The purpose of the project was to produce market data for our clients and have them route orders to us the way they would to a protected market. I used Python to improve a program that insured that we were executing our clients at the best price on the market (Easier said than done). Working on the ILP project gave me a deeper and richer insight into the complexity of market data.

Eventually, I moved on to _C/C++_. Although I left before I could show my skills in _C/C++_, I believe that my former colleagues would be happy with my growth.
