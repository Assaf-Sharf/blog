The concept of the Barefoot Ecologist's Toolbox originated with [Jeremy Prince's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Prince) work in the early 2000s (Prince, [2003](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00134.x/abstract)).  

The idea for the website itself grew out of the length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR) work (Prince et al. [2015](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/1/194.short); Hordyk et al. 2015[a](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/1/217.short), [b](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/1/204.short), and Hordyk et al. [2016](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0422)) which highlighted the importance of assessment models for data-limited fisheries that were robust and reliable while straight-forward to understand and implement.  
 
The website was originally developed by [Adrian Hordyk](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian_Hordyk) and [Jeremy Prince](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Prince).  [Jason Cope](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason_Cope) developed the [Shiny application estimating the natural mortality rate](\shiny_M), and has become an important contributor to the site.

[Neil Loneragan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/N_Loneragan) has been an important collaborator in the development of the concept for the website, as well as the development of the LBSPR approach, and the web-based applications that are based on it. 

## Collaboration
We hope that The Barefoot Ecologist's Toolbox can become a central hub for applications and information relating to the assessment and management of data-limited fisheries, and welcome anyone who is interested in collaborating or contributing to the site to contact us either through [email](mailto:barefootecologist@gmail.com) or through [GitHub](https://github.com/Barefoot-Ecologist-Toolbox/barefoot-ecologist-toolbox.github.io).  

**If you've developed a fisheries-related Shiny application, we'd love to include it on the site!**

  
## Acknowledgements
We'd like to acknowledge the support of [Murdoch University](www.murdoch.edu.au), and [The David and Lucile Packard Foundation](www.packard.org) for the development and maintenance of this website.

The LBSPR Shiny application is based on an earlier PHP-based version that was developed as part of the USAID [IMACS project](http://www.chemonics.com/OurWork/OurProjects/Pages/Indonesia%20Marine%20and%20Climate%20Support%20Project.aspx). Their support is gratefully acknowledged.     

## About the Site 
This site is built with a collection of open-source software packages, and is only possible due to the generosity and hardwork of many people and organisations. 

The site is freely hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),  the open-source  static site generator. 
 
The theme is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), a highly flexible Jekyll theme developed and generously shared by [Michael Rose]( https://mademistakes.com/)

The applications have been built using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) a R package developed, maintained, and freely shared by [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).  

Of course, the Shiny apps themselves run in [R]( https://www.r-project.org/), a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.   

Many thanks to all involved in developing and maintaining these fantastic resources. And a big shout-out to the R and the Shiny communities, particularly on StackOverflow ([R](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) and [Shiny](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/shiny)), whose collective efforts ensure that creative solutions are shared or invented for every imaginable problem.
