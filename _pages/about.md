A quant, story teller, data scientist, automation geek, pianist and polygot. 

I'm fascinated with tech that solves big problems. 
Born in Malaysia. Now lives in Singapore.

Minimalist, contrarian and taming my lizard brain. There's only one way to know how a food taste - eat it. 

Check out my [project][{{ basepath }}/project] page to know what I'm doing now. But I'll love to [grab a cup of coffee][{{ basepath }}/contact] with you.
