A marketer that codes. 

A quant, story teller, data scientist, automation geek, pianist and speaks 5 languages. I'm fascinated with solving problems with tech and data. 

Currently lives in Singapore.

Minimalist, contrarian and taming my lizard brain. 

Motto: [Maranasati]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maranasati"). There's only one way to know how a food taste - eat it. 

Check out my [project]({{ basepath }}/project/) page to see what I'm doing now. 

I'll love to [grab a cup of coffee]({{ basepath }}/contact) with you too.
