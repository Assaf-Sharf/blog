I'm currently a [NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org) Physics Frontier Center (PFC)
postdoctoral fellow employed by WVU but working and living in the Research
Triangle area of NC. I am also a visiting postdoctoral scholar at NC State in
the Statistics department.

My research is primarily focused on the development of Bayesian data analysis
techniques for pulsar timing array science including gravitational wave
detection, noise characterization, non-linear timing, and interstellar
medium characterization.

I'm also very interested in machine learning and data science and strive to
pursue projects and learn more in those areas.

My full resume is available [here]({{ site.url }}/files/JAE-resume.pdf).
