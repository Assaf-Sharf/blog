Hi, I am a last-year undergraduate student in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). Previously, I was a research assistant at SCUT Machine Intelligence Lab (SMIL), working closely with Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. Qing Du. I also worked with Prof. [Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) and Prof. [Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/homepage) at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm).
