Hi, I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [CS Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Lifu Huang](https://wilburone.github.io/). I obtained my Bachelor degree in the [School of CSE](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). 
<!-- Previously, I was a research assistant at SCUT Machine Intelligence Lab (SMIL), working closely with Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. Qing Du. I also worked with Prof. [Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/homepage) at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm). Besides, I spent wonderful five months as an exchange student in the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). --> 

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae in PDF format](../files/Minqian_Liu_CV.pdf).

## Research Interests
My primary research interests lie in the field of **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. Specifically, I am interested in the following research topics: <br>
1) Continual learning for NLP
2) Knowledge-driven information extraction: extracting structured knowledge from text with commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning; <br>
3) Natural language generation: text summarization, machine translation, and automatic evaluation for text generation; <br>
