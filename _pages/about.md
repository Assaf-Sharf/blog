I am a Principal Data Scientist at [Infinia ML](https://infiniaml.com/). There I work on
a variety of client projects that cover most areas of machine learning and deep learning as
well as data mining. I also work on several internal projects in a more software-oriented role.

I'm very passionate about the Python programming language and its use in Machine Learning and
backend development. I love tinkering and learning tricks to help me be a better Python
programmer. I also have a growing interest in Web Development with Node.js/Python
and Vue/React and sharpening my ML deployment skills with Docker and Kubernetes.
