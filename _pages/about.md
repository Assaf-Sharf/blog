Having a background in 3d animation, I slowly delved into the amazing universe of coding after deciding I needed my very own place to showcase my work. Although I am sure others have probably gone through this same route, I have yet to find such examples and their stories and so I thought I would share my mine.

### More Information

To be honest, my interest for programming has always been there and, like many others, video games have played a big part on that. However, the arts proved to be a stronger passion at the time and so I enrolled in a technical school to study animation. If you haven't noticed yet, back in that time, I used to held the wrong assumption that both things were different, if not opposite. Of course, experience and grey hairs growing on my head would eventually help me realize this was a complete mistake.

And what a mistake it was. As soon as typed my first and very basic lines of code, not only did I realize that coding was a form of art, but I also felt the pure joy it was. And so it stroke me like a startling revelation: it is all the same! Whether you use a brush and a canvas, a bunch of clay or a good old text editor, in the end, you are creating!

It is from this perspective then that I want to share my discorveries and tribulations as I carry on with this journey through the incredible universe of coding, FOSS and beyond, and let it be known and forever recorded for all travellers to see.
