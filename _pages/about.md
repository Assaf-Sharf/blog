Yo Ho! I'm Mohamed Taher Ben Salem (call me Taher). I'm a DevOps engineer with experience with cloud technologies, CI/CD, scripting, software development, and I ate a Carolina Reaper pepper (bad idea).

During my studies and career, I've amassed thousands of notes and text documents on technology.

The purpose of this blog ***THE EXPERIMENT*** is to clean up all of the information gathered during the years to make both useful to myself and share it with others.

If you'd like to know more about me and my professional career, you can find more details in my LinkedIn profile.
