I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) advised by Prof. [Lifu Huang](https://wilburone.github.io/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degree in the [School of CSE](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xCR8nrwAAAAJ&hl=en)] [[Curriculum Vitae](../files/Minqian_Liu_CV.pdf)].
<!-- Previously, I was a research assistant at SCUT Machine Intelligence Lab (SMIL), working closely with Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. Qing Du. I also worked with Prof. [Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/homepage) at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm). Besides, I spent wonderful five months as an exchange student in the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). --> 

***I am actively seeking for research internship positions in Summer 2022!***


## Research Interests
My primary research interests lie in the field of **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. Currently, I am interested in the following topics: <br>
1) **Language technology for real-world applications:** continual learning and few/zero-shot learning for NLP; <br>
2) **Knowledge-driven information extraction:** extracting structured information from text empowered by external knowledge sources; <br> 
3) **Pre-trained language models and prompt-based learning for NLP**; <br>
4) **Multi-modal learning and cross-modal reasoning**. 
<!-- 3) **Natural language generation:** text summarization, machine translation, and automatic evaluation for text generation. <br> -->
