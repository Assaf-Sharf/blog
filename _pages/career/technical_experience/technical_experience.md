# Overview

This section of my website is meant to serve as a deep dive into my experience with certain tools, past projects, and roles. For a high-level overview, please [refer to my resume](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.abdulrabbani.com/Abdul_Rabbani_resume_20210901.pdf).

# Tech Insight

Throughout my career in tech, I have had the pleasure of having many teachers and learning many things. Some of my teachers have been books, videos, online courses, and best of all, people. Below, I have summarized and linked the posts that capture my experience with prominent tools. To read any of the posts and to see my experiences in more detail, please click on the appropriate link.

  - **Core Internet Protocols** - Emphasizing my understanding of core internet protocols at a development level, instead of simply understanding them at a user level.

# Featured Projects

The following links highlight a few projects that I’ve worked on in some of my previous roles. Fair warning, I will mostly capture my experience working in finance, as most of my experience working in tech can be captured within the “DevOps Tools” section.

- [**Internal Trading Market**](/categories/career/technical_experience/internal_trading_market) - At Societe General, I was responsible for creating an “internal market” that external clients would be able to route orders to. Learn about my experience with **Python**, **Pandas**, **market data**, **order entry**, and **smart order routing (SOR)** [here](/categories/career/technical_experience/internal_trading_market).

- [**Microwave**](/categories/career/technical_experience/microwave) - At Societe General, I worked very closely with our Microwave instances. Learn about my experience configuring, analyzing, testing, upgrading, and architecting solutions for Microwaves [here](/categories/career/technical_experience/internal_trading_market).

# Past Experience

Here I capture a few of my past roles of great significance.

## Mobiz Inc

In the first half of 2021, I was the head of engineering at Mobiz Inc, a start-up based in California. At Mobiz, I was responsible for overseeing the engineering department and implementing processes and standards. While at Mobiz, I learned a great deal about client-facing businesses and consulting. I thoroughly enjoyed mentoring engineers, sharing my knowledge and love for tech, and seeing them improve and grow.

While at Mobiz, I also helped shift the company into the Agile methodology, migrating all projects to Jira and using Confluence for documentation. By improving the project management process, the organization was able to have more efficient cycles, better communication, and strong client relationships.

Through this managerial position, I gained many valuable skills which I will continue to develop such as project planning, client-facing communication, and delegation. Although I enjoyed many aspects of leading an engineering department, I deeply missed being an engineer. I learned that I am committed to sharing knowledge and helping others improve their understanding of our field, but, ultimately, I most enjoy this work from a hands-on approach. Working at Mobiz was a great opportunity, and it helped me learn a lot about myself and what I want.

In my next role, I would love to combine my experience as a manager and my experience as an engineer. I believe I could have a more meaningful impact with this approach. Instead of telling the engineers what the best practices are, I would love to actively implement them throughout the organization. From my experience, engineers are more susceptible to influence when it comes from a fellow engineer, one that understands their perspective. In the future, I want to utilize my skills to ensure that the management and engineering team are on the same page, with the same goals in mind.

## Microsoft-PromoteIQ

From 2019-2021 I was a DevOps Engineer at a start-up called PromoteIQ, which is owned by Microsoft. PromoteIQ is an advertising firm that works in the private marketplace. My job there was to maintain all the servers, networks, applications, and infrastructure to be able to serve ads for our clients.

Part of being a good DevOps Engineer is making sure you are not doing the same work twice. Infrastructure, applications, networks, servers, and other pieces of technology constantly need to be replicated and changed. Technology is great because if you work smarter, you can program it to do a lot for you. Some of the tools that I leveraged to make my life easier were _**Ansible**,_ **Python**_,_ **Terraform**_, and_ **Jenkins**.

Like many companies, PromoteIQ lives on the cloud and not just one. To meet client needs, PromotIQ has applications on **AWS**_,_ **GCP**_,_ **Azure**_,_ **Rackspace**_, and_ **Digital Ocean**. Because of strong leadership and smart engineers, we were able to serve clients out of various clouds with ease. Through PromoteIQ and its focus on automation and growth, I was able to understand what it takes to run a smart, sleek, and truly advanced shop in today's day and age.

I want to take the lessons learned here and apply them in my next role. Being part of a “tight ship” has shown me where most companies make mistakes in culture, collaboration, and innovation. I now understand the small, individual components that must work together for the crew to work better and can attempt to improve these components in my next role.

## Societe Generale

Before working for PromoteIQ, I was an SRE at Societe Generale, primarily focusing on the technology of the high-frequency, low-latency trading desk. My main focus was maintaining trading applications, with latency and performance in mind. Some of my topics of interest were **microwave**_,_ **market data**_, and_ **smart order routing (SOR)**.

At SocGen, I learned to work very closely with physical hardware. Although I did not touch any servers in my time there, I was quickly able to decipher the right tool for the right job. Furthermore, with the help of some talented individuals, I became an experienced programmer at SocGen.

I started by learning **Python** and quickly began working on the ILP (Internal Liquidity Provider) project. The purpose of the project was to produce market data for our clients and have them route orders to us the way they would to a protected market. I used Python to improve a program that insured that we were executing our client's requests at the best price on the market (Easier said than done). Working on the ILP project gave me a deeper and richer insight into the complexity of market data.

Eventually, I moved on to **C/C++**. Although I left before I could show my skills in **C/C++**, I believe that my former colleagues would be happy with my growth.

Working directly with trading applications in a programmatic way, I was able to intimately learn their internal features and functions. The lessons learned through projects like ILP gave me a deeper and richer insight into the complexity of market data, order entry, smart order routing, microwaves, and data manipulation. I hope to bring this insight to a company dedicated to creating robust, efficient, and dynamic trading systems.
