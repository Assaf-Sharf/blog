Security professionals have a lot of data to deal with on a daily basis. While Splunk can help put all of that data into one place, gaining visibility has taken a lot of effort. In order to better deal with the problem, we have developed _Aplura Security for Splunk_.

We combine our security expertise and Splunk experience to create a solution that provides security visibility and accelerates the time-to-value for your Splunk data. We put our years of delivering services and consulting to work for our customers by delivering a set of free Splunk apps and an advanced content subscription to take full advantage of Aplura’s collective knowledge. The apps provide the most requested security searches and dashboards for your team. The subscription will provide additional value in the form of up to date searches, current security events, and additional news items. The goal is better security, at minimal extra effort, with minimal cost.

The apps are modular in that you can use one, several or all. We’ve also created a central Security App for Splunk to give your team a single place to perform security research and analysis. Our Splunk app solution is free to use and is available now on [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/aplura_llc).
