## Submesoscale instabilities in the ocean bottom boundary layer

Coming soon!



## Vertical mixing of materials in the upper ocean

![GRL paper](/assets/images/GRL2019-panels.png)

I've been using [Large eddy
simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_eddy_simulation) to explore small scale
turbulence in the Oceanic mixed layer. Focus is given to the transport of passive scalars
(such as oil, microplastic and nutrients) and parameterizations that help us predict such
transport.

## Turbulent fluxes or greenhouse gases over grasslands, lakes and forests

I have made several field trips to install micrometeorological stations to
measure things like wind speed, temperature and humidity at high frequencies
(at least 10 Hz). I then processed the data to gain insight on turbulent fluxes
in diverse locations. Scroll below to see some pictures with their respective
locations.

## Groundwater transport in porous aquifers

In this project (which I pursued as my Masters project) I aimed to take a
theoretical approach and obtain analytical solutions for the Boussinesq
equation, which model the movement of water in a homogeneous aquifer. We ended
up publishing a few new exact solution for the case when the boundary
conditions are constant in time.

# Some field work pictures

### Amazon - BR (October 2015)

Field work in the Amazon whose goal was to aid installation of instruments
at the [ATTO project](https://www.attoproject.org/) site.

### Tijucas do sul - BR (around 2014)

The goal of this field was to measure meteorological variables with a drone
while also taking auxiliary micromet measurements on ground.

### Itaipu lake - BR (around 2014)

Continuous field campaign that lasted a year and aimed to study turbulent
fluxes on lakes and sensor decorrelation effects.
