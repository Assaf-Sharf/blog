We are a group of researchers and developers interested in the analysis, design, and development of knowledge-based information
systems.

Most of our topics revolve around the application of [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) principles
and technologies in the aforementioned information systems.

## Research Topics

- Conceptual modelling, ontology design
- Linked data, Semantic Web
- Semantic data integration
- Semantic Web-based information systems and software libraries
- Ontology-based information extraction from text
