# The Space

The cryptocurrency space has been booming over the last few years. While most of the general population only thinks of Bitcoin and Ethereum when considering the crypto space, there's so much more to it. Some exciting projects in the crypto space include:

-   Decentralized Finance (Defi)
    
    -   Automated Market Making (AMM)
        
    -   Liquidity Pools (LP's)
        
-   Decentralized Applications (Dapps)
    
-   Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
    
-   The Metaverse
    
-   Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO's)
    
-   Web 3.0
    

# The Technology

As a developer, engineer, and mathematician, the crypto space appeals to all of my interests. Some of the tools, technologies, and concepts I am learning/have learned to provide value to the area are:

-   **Rust** - A powerful programming language.
    
-   **Solidity** - A programming language used primarily to write smart contracts
    
    -   Truffle - Development Framework
        
    -   Remix - A browser-based IDE
        
    -   Hardhat - Development + Testing
        
    -   Brownie - Unit Testing in Python
        
    -   OpenZeppelin
        
-   [**Etheruem Virtual Machine (EVM)**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)  - "It's the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live."
    
-   Merkle Treeâ€™s

# My Intention

My goal is to provide positive value to the people, the projects, and the ideas in the crypto space. I plan to contribute as an engineer, a student, an educator, a validator, and a creative. I would love it if you were part of my journey!
