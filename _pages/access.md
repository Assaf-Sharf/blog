## Accessing the FiQCI infrastructure

Access to the quantum computing resources goes through the LUMI supercomputer environment.

The pilot phase for access will open very soon!


### Access to LUMI

See the LUMI [webpage](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/get-started-2021/users-in-finland/) for details on how to get access to the LUMI environment.
