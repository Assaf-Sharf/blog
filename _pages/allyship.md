    Helping others succeed extends beyond the technical aspects of our jobs, it also means influencing
    the culture and improving everyone’s experience at work.
  </p>

    Growing up, we were taught to “not see color”, men were told that “women’s rights were women’s issues”,
    and everyone knew that if “you worked hard, you’d succeed”. As I entered adulthood, it dawned on me
    that there were problems with those assumptions. They’re built around the persona I embody: a white,
    cisgender, heterosexual, able-body, middle-income man. In order to understand how I can improve the
    lives of people who identify differently than me, I’ve spent a lot of my time since then listening to
    others and exposing myself to different experiences. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about diversity
    and inclusion, gained an understanding of how I can make an impact, and changed my behavior many times
    to do so. I’m still learning, and I enjoy sharing my experiences with others.
