Helping others succeed extends beyond the technical aspects of our jobs, it also means
influencing the culture and improving everyone’s experience at work.

Growing up in the 1970's and 80's, we were taught to “not see color”, men were told that
“women’s rights were women’s issues”, and everyone knew that if “you worked hard, you’d succeed”.
As I entered adulthood, it dawned on me that there were problems with those assumptions.
They’re built around the persona I embody: a white, cisgender, heterosexual, able-body,
middle-income man. In order to understand how I can improve the lives of people who
identify differently than me, I’ve spent a lot of my time since then listening to others
and exposing myself to different experiences. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about diversity
and inclusion, gained an understanding of how I can make an impact, and changed my behavior many
times to do so. I’m still learning, and I enjoy sharing my experiences with others.

**_Coming soon!_** Thoughts on allyship; how to build awareness; discussing allyship
with others; and suggestions for practicing allyship and advocacy. These will be based on my presentation
at [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org/)'s [Male Ally Summit 2019](https://community.anitab.org/event/male-ally-summit-2019/).
