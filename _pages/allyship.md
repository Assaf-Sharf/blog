    Helping others succeed extends beyond the technical aspects of our jobs, it also means influencing
    the culture and improving everyone’s experience at work.

    Growing up, we were taught to “not see color”, men were told that “women’s rights were women’s issues”,
    and everyone knew that if “you worked hard, you’d succeed”. As I entered adulthood, it dawned on me
    that there were problems with those assumptions. They’re built around the persona I embody: a white,
    cisgender, heterosexual, able-body, middle-income man. In order to understand how I can improve the
    lives of people who identify differently than me, I’ve spent a lot of my time since then listening to
    others and exposing myself to different experiences. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about diversity
    and inclusion, gained an understanding of how I can make an impact, and changed my behavior many times
    to do so. I’m still learning, and I enjoy sharing my experiences with others.
