Hello! Welcome to Jay's Note
![](/images/image1.jpg){: .align-right width="320"}
I am currently a senior student of Stony Brook University and expected graduation date on December 16, 2022. <br>
This is my personal github blog and studied html to make it. (Theme by https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
