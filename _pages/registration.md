Something about the registration fee and other info.

## Useful Links

Should create google forms for the following

If you wish to present a talk, register through the following link:

[Present a talk]({{ "/" | relative_url }}){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}

Otherwise, if you do not plan on presenting or are unsure about it, use this link instead:

[No talk]({{ "/" | relative_url }}){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}
