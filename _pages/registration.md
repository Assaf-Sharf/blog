Registration and abstract submission will open in July 2023. We will be accepting abstracts for contributed talks as well as posters. 


## Useful Links

Should create google forms for the following

If you wish to present a talk, register through the following link:

[Present a talk]({{ "/" | relative_url }}){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large} 

add similar stuff for poster option. Include question in the form: if you are not allocated a talk, would you like to present a poster? (yes / no) 

Otherwise, if you do not plan on presenting at all, use this link instead:

[No presentation]({{ "/" | relative_url }}){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}
