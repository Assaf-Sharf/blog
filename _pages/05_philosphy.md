# Philosophical Soapbox
<img src="/media/soapbox.jpg" width="75%">

The following is a treatise on the philosophical aspects of using a service like the **BERN**. What follows is nothing but personal opinion regarding values, responsibilities, and liberties. None of this is required reading, nor is it meant to cast the **BERN** in policial light. To be clear the **BERN** is an apolitical entity.

Rather, it seeks to explain objectively why someone might to to the expense, time, effort, and trouble of creating and using a network less well-featured, as compared to commercial offerings.
## Fundamental Human Needs
<img src="/media/maslows.png">

Human existence requires several fundamental resources. Among them, food, water, shelter, etc.
As soon as we add more than one human to the mix, the ability to communicate soon rises to become another fundamental need.

 - Without access to reliable communication, it is impossible to make considered decisions.
 - Without communication, society devolves rapidly, as you have no notion of why people are doing what they're doing, whether you should be doing a thing, or whether anyone, anywhere is doing anything based on sound reasoning or logic.
 - Without communication, we are all individuals without the capacity for cooperation.

On the hierarchy of needs, communication may not fill a hungry belly, or quench a thirst, but it can inform you where, how, and when it is safe and reliable to do those things. Without the ability to reliably relay information to another human, it is impossible to raise ones considerations above that of the sole individual. Communication is paramount to any functional society as soon as the number of participants is greater than one.
## Centralization of Authority
<img src="/media/central_authority.jpg" width="50%">

We live in a highly centralized society. People from hundreds or thousands of miles away make decisions, enacting policy which has direct impact on how you live your life. This may take the shape of State or Corporate actors, or more often, a combination of the two. These policy makers don't know you and don't have your best interests at heart, yet they are making decisions that have the potential to reach into your life and change it in fundamental ways.

In the meantime, a shockingly small number of corporate actors have complete control over what you hear, see, or are able to talk about in the digital square. History is rife with cautionary tales of autocratic states built on the backs, and bones, of their own citizens. 

> "Central authority is bad. The bias should be for freedom.
> And without a central authority, there are lots of little authorities, and we learn which ones to trust." -John Stossel

It is not a good state of affairs when someone who doesn't know you and cannot begin to perceive of your life, has the ability to cut off your electricity, power, bank accounts, automobile, or ability to communicate. Yet, this is our world today

## Parallel Systems
<img src="/media/pirate_radio.webp" width="50%">

During the Cold War, countries under the heel of the Soviet Union were successful in shaking off the authoritarian yoke of the USSR by building, maintaining, and working within so-called, Parallel Systems.

Rather than utilize State services for things like banking, medicine, libraries, access to culture, the people created their own parallel systems, and only served one another. In so doing, the official agencies withered from lack of use while the people received better, more reliable goods and services, through these unofficial, parallel systems.

It is no exaggeration to suggest that the collapse of the USSR and the rise of progressive democracies throughout the former Eastern Bloc nations owes significant debt to those parallel systems those brave citizens were able to establish and maintain them in the face of a powerful cental authority which sought to eliminate such things.
## Promise of the Mesh
<img src="/media/mesh_diagram_houses.png">

The **BERN** and other mesh networks like it represent a wholly different paradigm of communications. Nobody owns the **BERN**, but everyone with a radio owns a part of it.

> If no one owns it, no one controls it.
> If no one controls it, no one can shut it down.
> If no one can shut it down, it's more powerful than anyone who dare try!

There is no corporation to commoditize your personal data, boosting corporate profits by selling your private information to the highest bidder. There are no advertisements, no shadow-bans, no algorithms, no commercials, and no content moderation of any kind.

The $35 radio you hold in your hand may not seem like much. After all, it is a lot of work to achieve something as mundane as text messaging. However, that $35 is an investment in buying a slice of independence. A tiny victory in principal, in a world *hell bent* on creating a subservient race of paid subscribers and consumers for all conceivable needs.

There aren't too things left in this world like this, but here is one way you can take something back from those who would use technology as a yoke to control you.

> No one controls the **BERN**, Everyone controls the **BERN**.

## Does that make the BERN some kind of Prepper thing?
<img src="/media/Doomsdaytremors.webp" width="50%">

No! The **BERN** and other mesh networks are what you make of them. They can be used for something as mundane as local, neighborhood gossip, road and weather reports, or something as serious as emergency search & rescue. 

Can it be considered a *"prepper thing"*?

Sure, but it's far, far more than that! The use cases are as wide and varied as your own imagination!

*Do your part for yourself and your community, join the **BERN**, or your local mesh network today!*
