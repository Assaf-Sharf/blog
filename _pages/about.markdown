The Cybersec and Security Engineering blogs..

![home](/assets/images/link.png){:class="img-responsive"}

I am a software developer, ethical hacker and cyber security enthusiast, mathematician. Love the nature.

I want to express special thanks to myself, as well as to all my relatives who endure me when I'm strange, when I programming and hack, but they always support me in everything.
