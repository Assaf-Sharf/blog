When we develop software packages we try to use DevOps methods. Our larger projects employ automatic testing and using continuous integration/ continuous development servers (TracisCI and CircleCI).

Our software is available on the Genomics and Bioinformatics Unit's Github repository
[USDA-ARS-GBRU Github](https://github.com/usda-ars-gbru).

When we run data analysis we are committed to publishing reproducible research
by documenting the computational methods we use in analyses and making the
source code of those analyses publicly available.
Examples of our reproducible workflows are:

* [Fire ant virus paper repository](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/fire_ant_viruses)
* [Copenhagen Ancient DNA paper](https://github.com/arivers/copenhagen_moat)

ITSxpress | ITSxpress is a stand alone CLI and a QIIME 2 package for trimming the internally transcribed spacer regions with quality scores in amplicon sequencing experiments. The software was published in 2018 doi:[10.12688/f1000research.15704.1](https:/doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.15704.1)| [ITSxpress on  Github](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/itsxpress) and [Q2-ITSxpress](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/q2_itsxpress)
Vica      | Still in development, software for identifying highly divergent viruses in DNA and RNA me)tagenomes using deep learning using Tensorflow | [Vica on Github](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/vica)
ARS-RQC   | Still in development, an automated Illumina quality control workflow and visualization web application | [ARS-RQC on Github](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/ARS-RQC)
