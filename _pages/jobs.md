I recently received 4 grants to develop research
in a few key areas: 1) Developing computational tools for agricultural problems, 2) Developing methods to engineer microbial consortia and 3) developing methods to link host genotypes to microbiomes. Some of the positions have flexibility to develop independent research under a broad theme.

I am working to add 5 people to the group with overlapping interests in machine learning, microbial ecology, probabilistic graph models and data integration. Most positions are computational but some projects have a field or wet lab component.  Since I am hiring a cohort of people together I will be looking for complementary skills and an interest in working in a collaborative  environment.  If you do not see a position below that is an exact match but are interested in the lab please contact me to discuss your interests.
