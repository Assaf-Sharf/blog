## CDIS Protected Data Clouds

The scalable, open-source software architecture that has been developed by CDIS supports the following data clouds and data commons.
<br>

* #### [Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud (PDC)]({{site.url}}/resources/pdc) 
The PDC is the first open-source, cloud-based computational platform that allows researchers authorized by NIH to compute over human genomic data in a secure and compliant fashion.  Bionimbus and related cloud-based infrastructures are used by researchers working on cancer, diabetes, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

* #### Atwood Protected Data Cloud
The Atwood Protected Data Cloud supports numerous faculty and research projects at the University of Chicago. Atwood provides scalable storage and compute resources with co-located data, informatics applications, and tools.  Numerous researchers throughout the Biological Sciences Division rely on Atwood for their projects, specifically in the departments of Health Studies, Medicine, Pediatrics, and Human Genetics.

## CDIS Collaborations with the National Cancer Institute

* #### [Genomic Data Commons (GDC)]({{site.url}}/resources/gdc)
The GDC is a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to create the nationâ€™s most comprehensive computational facility.  The GDC will store and harmonize cancer genomic data generated through NCI-funded research programs.

## CDIS Collaborations with the Open Cloud Consortium

* #### [Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC)]({{site.url}}/resources/osdc)
OSDC is a large-scale science cloud deployed in 2009 that makes large datasets and cloud-computing infrastructures available to data scientists around the world.

<br>

* #### [Project Matsu](http://matsu.opensciencedatacloud.org/)
Matsu is a collaboration between NASA and the Open Cloud Consortium to develop open source technology for cloud-based processing of satellite imagery to support the earth sciences.  The OSDC is used to process Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite imagery from the Advanced Land Imager and the Hyperion instruments and to make this data available to interested users. We are currently working on developing services for detecting fires and floods and getting relevant information to first responders.

* #### [Biomedical Commons Cloud (BCC)]({{site.url}}/resources/bcc)
BCC is a new Open Cloud Consortion (OCC) project allowing university, medical research centers, and companies to jointly leverage private, secure compliant clouds operated by the OCC within the context of a larger, commercial open ecosystem to facilitate discoveries in biology, medicine, and healthcare.
