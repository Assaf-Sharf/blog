Want a site that to showcase your idea and products online? A site that can easily change from a blog to an ecommerce in the future? A Wordpress website is the best Minimal-Viable-Product (MVP) for you. 

I started this gig as a sharing economy with my friends. I'm keen to help people who are just starting out online.

# What you can expect:
***
- A fully-customizable 10-page website done in a week. Use it for your blogging, portfolio and gallery showcase.
- A mobile-responsive website
- 99% server uptime (I had bad experiences with Bluehost or Hostgator so I know how important is this.)
- Your vision for your business may change as it grows. Your website will be easily adaptable too. Want to transform into an e-commerce site? An e-learning platform? Nothing on Wordpress will restrict you.

# Portfolio

# FAQS:
***
- Is it easy to add/remove content and images?
> Yes! It's Wordpress and you'll have full admin access. You can change fonts, colors and add plugins if you like.

- Which hosting company are you using?
> Siteground servers hosted in US.

- Can you handle my website if I'm getting lots of traffic?
> Can I get a selfie with you? If your site exceeds 20,000 traffic per month, I'll suggest you to have a separate server. Let's talk on [messenger](http://m.me/shawnlss){:target="_blank"}.
