If you've just started your business, you'll love data scraping. It's an quick and accurate way to collect big-data. Large companies use scraping on a larger scale to gain competitive intelligence. 

You could hire hundreds of Virtual Assistants (VA) to copy-paste data from websites. But this process is slow and the data may contain lots of human error. 

Say you're trying to get business address from a website. Here's what a VA will do:
1. Copy the URL and paste into web browser. A smart VA will use some Chrome extension to bulk open URLs in tabs.
2. Scroll to the section where it says "Contact Us"
3. Copy and paste into Excel.
4. Repeat for 10,000 companies.

Having worked in various data mining and web scrapping projects, I've built a big-data web harvesting system. You can now get access to my data gathering solution and starting making data-based decisions.

# FAQ:
***
- Can you extract this website (www...) ?
> Text me via messenger at [http://m.me/shawnlss](http://m.me/shawnlss){:target="_blank"}.

- Is this legal?
> Touchy topic... You're probably from a large company and not a hustler. Here's how my system is different. We don't extract at a disruptive rate - which may bring down the server. As long as we keep it in a safe rate, we are unlikely to breach any contract of terms of use (refer to [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act_(CFAA)) or your lawyer).

- How do you do it?
> Nothing magical. Just lots of carefully stacked systems and scripts coded in Python.

- Can your system key-in a form, click submit, and extract the result?
> Yes!

- Can your system extract Chinese or Korean?
> Yes!
