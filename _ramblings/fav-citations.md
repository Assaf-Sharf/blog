Comment: Welcome to my beach-planet resort ...

> What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?

Comment: While I would not recommend drawing life lesson from works of fiction, I could not help but make an exception for the one above.
The answer, however, is relative to the prespective one approaches it.
First, similarly to the saying "Ignorance is bliss", being born favored by Lady Luck is not that bad of an experience.
This would be better from the "quality of life" point of view.
On the hand, overcoming hardships thorughout one's life, as the dragon suggests, would result in a more "meaningful life".
From my experience, I would become aware of myself, my situtation and my thoughts more accurately when going through an "ordeal" (I must however admit that the ones I had to face so far were relatively insignificant ...), i.e. in troubled times. Those are the moments I would mature and improve the best, to a point that I could even notice it myself to a certain extent.
But again, this could only be an illusion of the "ego", giving us a satisfactory enough answer for the hardship that was endured, and motivating us to go even further (sometimes, even too much).

> It is better to go forward without an aim than loiter without an aim, and with surety much better than to retreat witjout an aim.

Comment: After finishing (or more likely failing) a research project, I would sometimes have no explicit objective and scarce ideas I could expand on.
In those time, this citation could be said to have kept me going more than once, as well as some other, similar ones.
When all your efforts and resources are depleted, one can only move forward, creating some force that will cause some reaction, relying on serendipitous events to build upon.
Otherwise, the likelihood of the situation improving is very low ... which quite an appropriate segway for the citation coming next.

> If anything can go wrong, it will.

<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>

Comment: Another interesting formulation would be that of Professor Jordan B. Peterson: ``When left to themselves, things tend to go wrong'' (if memory serves me correctly).
While this might encourage someone to lean and maybe even hang of the edge of pessimism, one lesson would be to always expect the worst case scenario.
