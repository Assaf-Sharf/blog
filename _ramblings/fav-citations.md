Comment: After finishing (or more likely failing) a research project, I would sometimes have no explicit objective and scarce ideas I could expand on.
In those time, this citation could be said to have kept me going more than once, as well as some other, similar ones.
When all your efforts and resources are depleted, one can only move forward, creating some force that will cause some reaction, relying on serendipitous events to build upon.
Otherwise, the likelihood of the situation improving is very low ... which quite an appropriate segway for the citation coming next.

> If anything can go wrong, it will.

Comment: Another interesting formulation would be that of Professor Jordan B. Peterson: ``When left to themselves, things tend to go wrong'' (if memory serves me correctly).
While this might encourage someone to lean and maybe even hang of the edge of pessimism, one lesson would be to always expect the worst case scenario.
