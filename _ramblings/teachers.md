# Motivation
I was just sitting there, when the sudden thought of what kind of teacher I would be if I ever had to.
Given that I would consider myself quite a slow student, and that my learning process must really be micro-step by micro-step, whatever I would try to explain would turn into an endless and likely hard to track bag of words.

Anyway, while I was thinking that, I tried to remember all the professors and teachers, be it in the academic or in a more broad sense, what actually made me not forget them, some things I found unfortunate in their teaching methods, and so on. Here we go.

Professor Sindagbe, a faint recollection of the "Sandwich theorem". For someone who was very strict, it was quite funny to hear him talk about sandwiches so seriously.
